== Before You Begin

Welcome to the *Developer Guide* for the NUS Module Planner! Unlike the *User Guide* that has been ordered in the flow for a user, this guide has been ordered lexicographically (specifically for _Implementation_) to assist you in finding the features and their implementations faster.

[TIP]
As usual, if you have questions, feature suggestions or bugs to report, feel free to open an issue in our *Issue Tracker* on GitHub!

== Setting Up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

[.text-center]
.Architecture Diagram

image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[align="center"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/planner/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/planner/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `student remove 1`.

.Component interactions for `student remove 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[align="center"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI Component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[align="center"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/planner/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g. `CalendarBox`, `CommandBox`, `GradWindow`, `ModuleCard`, `ModuleListPanel`, `ResultDisplay`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/planner/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic Component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[align="center"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/planner/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `PlannerParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a Student).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("student remove 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `student remove 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[align="center"]

NOTE: The lifeline for `StudentRemoveCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common Classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.planner.commons` package.

[[Implementation]]
== Implementation

This section describes our implementation and design decision details of the features in the NUS Module Planner. As a reminder, they have been ordered laconically for easier search and reference.

[[Implementation-Calendar]]
=== Calendar View

The application has a *"Calendar Schedule"* window implemented to allow students to see their timetable and lesson schedules. Once a lesson has been added, will they be visible in this window upon launch by the `Launch Calendar` button.

==== Calendar UI Implementation

There are two ways to view the Calendar. You can click on the launch calendar to see the lessons that you have added. Another way is to click on the semester button in the module description page to see the lessons available.

The Calendar builds its UI based on this implemented components:

* *Show Calendar* `setCalendar(List<Lesson> lessons)`

_We will add more about how we implemented this further, and the design decisions made._

.Activity Diagram for launching Calendar
image::CalendarActivityDiagram.png[align="center"]

The Calendar populates each of the Label in the grid pane based on the list of `Lesson` provided by the planner.

==== Design Considerations

* *Alternative 1 (Current implementation):* To build the table using scene builder with each labels being shaded to show the time
** Pros: Every single UI component of the calendar is customizable, allowing for further modifications.
** Cons: Tedious and duplicated code for each Label to be set a value.

* *Alternative 2:* Use another library jfxtras which has an i calendar API
** Pros: Reduce the amount of work needed to create the component
** Cons: Comes with bugs that scene builder is unable to support

[[Implementation-Grade]]
=== Grade Management

[[Implementation-GradReq]]
=== Graduation Requirements Features

The *Graduation Requirements* feature is what allows students to ensure that their academic plan and corresponding modules are assisting them towards fulfilling their own criteria to graduate.

==== Degree Management

The Graduation Requirements are made up of 2 implemented components:

* *Declaration of Major:* `major set`
* *Declaration of Specialisation:* `specialisation set`

The `Major` and `Specialisation` entities are automatically created and populated through the JSON data received from NUSMods. Furthermore, `Student` entities can only be associated in a _1-0..1_ relationship with a `Specialisation` entity.

The following high-level sequence diagrams illustrates the interactions between the `Ui`, `Logic` & `Model` components when either a *Major* or *Specialisation* is being set:

.Sequence Diagram for `Major` being set, with respect to `MainWindow` from `Ui`, `Logic` & `Model`
image::sequenceDiagramMajorSetLogicModelStorage.png[align="center"]

.Sequence Diagram for `Major` being set with respect to the `MajorSetCommand`
image::sequenceDiagramMajorSet.png[align="center"]

.Sequence Diagram for `Specialisation` being set (e.g. `AlgorithmsAndTheorySpecialisation`) with regards to `SpecialisationSetCommand`
image::sequenceDiagramSpecialisationSet.png[align="center"]

==== Verification of Graduation Requirement Fulfilment

Once the *Major* and *Specialisation* (if any), or a *Student* is set, the following logic is used to verify if the `Student` 's `GraduationRequirements` are being met, based on the list of `Module` which which the `Student` has enrolled in:

. Retrieval of the main base of the `GraduationRequirement` based on the `Major` and ultimately `DegreeProgram` of the `Student`.
. Retrieval of the list of `Module` which the `Student` has enrolled in.
. Passing in of the list of enrolled `Module` into each `GraduationRequirement` and determining if the `GraduationRequirement` has been met.
.. The modelling of the actual *Graduation Requirements* of NUS CS and IS undergraduate students are accomplished by making use of the various implementations of `GraduationRequirement` such as
... `CompoundGraduationRequirement` for groups of `Module` s which a `Student` is allowed to choose from, with certain conditions for fulfilment such as:
.... Minimum number of Module
.... Minimum number of Module Credits
.... At least a specified number of Modules with 4000-level or above
... `SpecialisationGraduationRequirement` for _"Specialisations" or "Tracks"_ depending on the terminology of the respective faculty that the `Major` belongs to).
... `WildcardGraduationRequirement` for Requirements that need to be fulfilled from a fixed pool of `Module` s which have `ModuleCode` s starting with certain characters (such as GEH, GES, GET)
. Thereafter, the corresponding `Module` entities that have been added will be verified against the compiled `Graduation Requirements`.
. Finally, requirements that are met, are checked or crossed accordingly - which is displayed in the left-panel of the GUI.

The flow of how the `Graduation Requirements` is put together with information from `Major` and `Specialisation` can be found in the below class diagram:

.Class Diagram of Graduation Requirements Implementation
image::#INSERTDIAGRAM[align="center"]

==== Design Considerations

* *Alternative 1 (Current Implementation):* Model real life graduation requirements in an OOP-manner with a different class for different types of requirements containing different logic determining the fulfilment of the graduation requirement, each inheriting from a base class to allow for polymorphism.
** Pros: Well Structured and separates actual requirements from the model by creating classes that provide the logic needed for fulfilment calculation.
** Cons: Each Programme will have to construct it's own combination of the various implementations `GraduationRequirement` to model actual graduation requirements.

* *Alternative 2:* Implement each `DegreeProgram` 's graduation requirement as a class on it's own.
** Pros: Each `DegreeProgram` can have the flexibility of customising fulfilment logic.
** Cons: Duplicate codes due to many classes may have the same fulfilment logic, but different data.

[[Implementation-Lesson]]
=== Lesson Features

The *Lesson Feature* allows students to manage the their respective lessons for the academic planning. When managing lessons, they are rendered in a *Lesson View Screen* in the GUI.

==== Lesson Implementation

The `Lesson` entities are automatically created and populated through the JSON data received from NUSMods. Furthermore, `Lesson` entities are coupled to `Module` entities in a _*..1_ relationship.

This coupling allows us to detect if a student tries to add duplicate `Lesson` entities and perform error handling or alternative advisement, where possible.

.Class Diagram of `Lesson` Implementation
image::LessonClassDiagram.png[align="center"]

The attributes of the `Lesson` class are retrieved from the serialised JSON file.

This implementation consist of 3 commands.

* `LessonAdd` - Finds the lessons from the module and add it into the list of lessons for the active student.
* `LessonList` - List down the lessons for the active student.
* `LessonRemove` - Remove the lessons from the active student based on the provided index.

===== Adding of Lesson
The `LessonAddCommandParser` method is called and it will get the `ModuleCode` and `Semester` provided by the arguments. It will run the `LessonDataImporter` class run method to convert the json file to `Lesson` Object. This is then added to the active student on the planner.

===== Listing of Lesson
The `LessonListCommand` method is called and it will iterate through the list of `Lesson` that is associated with the active student in the planner.

===== Deleting of Lesson
The `LessonRemoveCommandParser` method is called and it will get the `Index` provided by the arguments. It will retrieve the list of `Lesson` and delete the object based on the index given.

[[Implementation-Module]]
=== Module Features & Database

Bulk of the sections (of <<Implementation>>) and features throughout, require heavy interaction with the `Module` entities. *Modules* form the majority of what students will need to interact with, as these are the classes they must take and clear, in order to graduate.

==== Module Implementation

The `Module` entities are automatically created and populated through the JSON data received from NUSMods. The following class diagram below shows all the values that the `Module` entity stores or is associated with:

.Class Diagram of `Module` Implementation
image::ModuleClassDiagram.png[align="center"]

The attributes of the `Module` class are retrieved from the serialised JSON file.

Additionally, `Module` entities can be marked as `exempted` which allow Students to declare in the application, that will get the module credits associated, without having to declare taking it or associate a `Grade`.

[[Implementation-Module-Search]]
==== Module Search

On First Launch, all the modules that are available in NUS (in accordance to NUSMods data) is populated into the *Module Panel Screen*. This allows a student to select modules and view the corresponding module descriptions and details.

Students are able utilise the _"Search Bar"_ to search for any module based on the `module code` or `module name`. When given the query with the corresponding values, the following logic takes place:

.Sequence Diagram for Module Search
image::sequenceDiagramSearch.png[align="center"]

If any results match the query enetered, they are populated into the *Search Screen* GUI for the user.

== Backend & Debugging

[[Backend-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

[[Backend-JSON]]
=== JSON Handling & Live Data Management

As mentioned in several sections (of <<Implementation>>) above, NUS Module Planner has the capability to pull live data for entities, such as, `Major` and `Module`, via *JSON*.

*JSON* stands for _JavaScript Object Notation_ and is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data. We choose this syntax as it is "self-describing" and thus, easy to understand, while keeping our application size low.

_We will add more about how we implemented JSON and how we get, format, read and store the data._

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Backend-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Backend-SubCmd]]
=== Sub-Commands

_This section will be updated soon!_

== Documentation

Refer to the guide <<Documentation#, here>>.

== Testing

Refer to the guide <<Testing#, here>>.

== Dev Ops

Refer to the guide <<DevOps#, here>>.

== Proposed Future Enhancements

NUS Module Planner has a lot more potential to grow!


Below are some of the other great features we think can be implemented in v2.0 onward:

* *Module Viewer with Search* - Other than just searching for modules, search for their content instead, such as modules that deal with _Heat Transfer_ or _Geology_.
* *Timetable Planner with Friends* - Instead of just viewing timetables of different students (_i.e. friends_) separately, be able to overlay them in one _"Timetable View"_, for easier group planning.
* *Requirements Double-Upper* - Instead of just one `Major`, handle double `Major` programme students, or even those with Minors.
* *Module Popularity Prediction* - Get and analyse historic data from NUSMods about module uptake, so that students do not have to plan for modules that would be overly subscribed.
* *Support for Overseas Exchange and University Town College Programmes* - Be able to plan for special modules only offered in these programmes, if a student is enrolled in them.
