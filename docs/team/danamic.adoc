== PROJECT: NUS Module Planner

---

== Overview

The *NUS Module Planner* (_NUSModPlnr_) is for Computer Science (CS) students at the National University of Singapore (NUS) to manage their enrollments in NUS modules over their school life. **With NUSModPlnr, module planning has never been easier!**

The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 250+ kLoC.

My main contributions are the implementation of the Graduation Requirements interpretation and checking, as well as, managing the Issue Tracker and Releases.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *Graduation Requirement implementations and associated commands*.
** What it does: This feature allows students to ensure their Graduation Requirements are correct as of the NUS Website.
** Justification: This is a core feature, as the ability to ensure that modules are added and fulfil the criteria of a student's graduation requirements is monumental to their module planning.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: This feature was implemented with existing library support of the Java 11 bundle.

* *Minor enhancement*: added and modified a significant amount of the Test Cases and Unit Tests for the NUS Module Planner.

* *Code contributed*: Please see the link:++https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/#=undefined&search=danamic[RepoSense Report here]!
