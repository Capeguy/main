== PROJECT: NUS Module Planner

---

== Overview

The *NUS Module Planner* (_NUSModPlnr_) is for Computer Science (CS) students at the National University of Singapore (NUS) to manage their enrollments in NUS modules over their school life. **With NUSModPlnr, module planning has never been easier!**

The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 250+ kLoC.

My main contributions are the implementation of the Graduation Requirements interpretation and checking, as well as, managing the Issue Tracker and Releases.

== Summary of Contributions

* *Major Feature: Co-Developed `Graduation Requirements` implementations with associated commands*.
** *What it does*: This feature allows students to ensure their `Graduation Requirements` are correct as of the NUS Website, or in this case, for the requirements of NUS Computing's *Computer Science* and *Information Systems* `Majors` for Undergraduate Students.
** *Justification*: This is a core feature, as the ability to ensure that modules are added and fulfil the criteria of a student's graduation requirements is monumental to their module planning.
** *Highlights*: This feature *is the core feature* of the entire application, which is to allow students to better plan their modules better across semesters. This feature will also greatly affect existing commands and commands to be added in future.
** *Credits*: This feature was co-developed with _https://github.com/Capeguy[@Capeguy]_.

* *Major Feature: Implemented `Major` and `Major Set` Command, for Users who wish to change their Student's Major retroactively.*
** *What it does*: This feature allows students to change their `Major`, with _Computer Science (CS)_ and _Information Systems (IS)_ Majors currently supported.
** *Justification*: This feature allows students to ensure that their `Graduation Requirements` match the `Major` that they are taking for their course.
** *Highlights*: This feature was interesting to implement because of how the different majors were listed on the NUS Website (particularly for NUS Computing).

* *Major Feature: Co-Developed the foundational code for `Planner` and associated classes for all other advanced features to be built upon.*
** *What it does*: allows the other developers to work around a baseline formed around the framework provided by AddressBook-Level3.
** *Justification*: This initial refactoring of AddressBook to Planner is important and needs to be done synchronously and before other portions of code can be developed as this forms the basis of which other features rely on.
** *Highlights*: This feature blocks the entire application development and needed to be completed fast so as not to impede progress of other team members. As this was a lot to do at once, I have had the help of https://github.com/Capeguy[@Capeguy] and @gruntultra in order to push this foundational code out.
** *Credits*: The original code from AddressBook-Level3, https://github.com/Capeguy[@Capeguy] and https://github.com/gruntultra[@gruntultra].

* *Major Enhancement: Worked with https://github.com/Capeguy[@Capeguy] to ensure all `Module` entities loaded from all JSON files contained the right information to be used in the application.*
** *What it does*: Ensures that the `Module` entities are properly populated with the right data from the JSON files created and retrieved from NUSMods.
** *Justification*: This aspect was important as aside from allowing the application to work offline, the data needed to be properly parsed in order to be able to populate the `Module` entities in the application.
** *Highlights*: This was an interesting enhancement to complete because of the complexity in the amount of data that can be retrieved from the NUSMods API via JSON.
** *Credits*: This feature was co-developed with https://github.com/Capeguy[@Capeguy].

* *Minor Enhancement*: Added and modified a significant amount of the Test Cases and Unit Tests for the NUS Module Planner.

* *Minor Enhancement*: Created helper classes to facilitate easier testing of models such as TypicalModule and ModuleBuilder
