== PROJECT: NUS Module Planner

---

== Overview

The NUS Module Planner (NUSModPlnr) is for Computer Science (CS) students at the National University of Singapore (NUS) to manage their enrollments in NUS modules over their school life. With NUSModPlnr, module planning has never been easier!

The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 250+ kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major feature*: Importing of all lessons for each module offered by NUS, made available using the NUSMods.
** What it does: Allows the user to view the list of all the lessons offered by NUS for a given modules, including details such as class number, start time, end time, venue.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can view actual accurate data of the lessons currently being offered by NUS for a given module, with the latest data available.
** Highlights: This feature allows the calendar portion of the application to be filled up. As real life data was provided by NUSMods, there was no need to populate with fake data.
** Credits: NUSMods for providing the data and API.

* *Major feature*: Revamped the entire UI of the application.
** What it does: Allows the user to use the application with an interface instead of a command line.
** Justification: This feature allows the application to be more user friendly and also show information that would be deem hard to read through a command line.
** Highlights: The calendar was build from scratch using grid panes and anchor panes.
** Credits: SceneBuilder.
