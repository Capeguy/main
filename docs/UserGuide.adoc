Thank you for your interest in the *NUS Module Planner* and welcome to the *User Guide*!

== Introduction

The *NUS Module Planner* (_NUSModPlnr_) is for Computer Science (CS) students at the National University of Singapore (NUS) to manage their enrollments in NUS modules over their school life. **With NUSModPlnr, module planning has never been easier!**

When starting up the application, you will be able to see the *Home Screen* (_Figure 1. below_).

Do you want to keep track of the modules you will be taking over multiple semesters? Do you want to easily create multiple plans of these multiple semesters?

Are you frustrated about managing the numerous details of the graduation requirements for a CS degree? NUSModPlnr allows you to check which graduation requirements you can satisfy, on the fly.

Do you want to keep track of your grades to better decide on which modules to enrol in? NUSModPlnr provides a simple way to calculate grade statistics.

If you can type fast, NUSModPlnr can help you plan your modules in a fast, yet intuitive way. NUSModPlnr is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

== How To Use This User Guide

NUSModPlnr is a timetable and enrollment management application, which help you add plans which consist of your degree programme and timetables for different semesters.

//Within each timetable, users can add modules they intend to enrol in. After managing student plans, timetables and modules, users can request information about the plan. This includes the student's cumulative grades and the status of graduation requirements (for the degree programme that was set).

====
This *User Guide* is designed to bring you through the following features:

. Viewing Help
. Creating a New Student
. Declaring a Major
. Viewing and Adding Modules
. Viewing, Adding and Selecting Timetables
. Managing and Viewing Grades

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `nusmodplnr.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your NUS Module Planner.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

== Features

These are the key features that are part of the NUSModPlnr!

[TIP]
Before you dive into the commands themselves, do familiarise yourself with how the *User Guide* has been formatted in terms of the commands to key in!

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you (e.g. in `student add n/NAME major/MAJOR`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `student add n/John Doe major/CS`).
* Items in square brackets are optional (e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`).
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times (e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc).
* Parameters can be in any order (e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME major/MAJOR`, `major/MAJOR n/NAME` is also acceptable).
