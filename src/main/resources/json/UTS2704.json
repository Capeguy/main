Singapore imports over 90% of its food supply and uses under 1% of its land area for agriculture.\nIn 2015, Singapore was ranked the second most food secure country in the world. On the other hand, Singaporeâs food wastage has increased by 50% since 2005 and 1 in 10 people in Singapore is food insecure. This module takes a systems thinking and systems dynamics perspective to analyse and understand this apparent paradox between food security and food waste in\nSingapore.","title":"Hard to secure easy to waste - Singaporeâs food story","department":"Residential College 4","faculty":"Residential College","workload":[0,3,0,4,3],"prerequisite":"GEM1918 or GEM1919 or UTC1700 or UTC1701 or UTC1702%","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"UTS2704","attributes":{"su":true},"aliases":["UTC2712"],"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1830","endTime":"2130","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"RC4-SR1-2","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":11}]}],"prereqTree":{"or":["GEM1918","GEM1919","UTC1700","UTC1701","UTC1702"]}}
