{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"PS3201B, PS3231","description":"This course will explore the emerging field of comparative political theory by considering to what extent it stands as a coherent, independent subfield, and what if any are the questions it is specifically poised to answer. Our treatment will be both topical and methodological. We will begin by reading the work of contemporary scholars who explicitly situate themselves within “comparative” as opposed to mainstream canonical political theory, and/or who use comparison as a tool for elucidating particular political problems. In the second part of the course, we will read primary sources that undertake comparative or synthetic perspectives on formulating theory in the modern world, but from selfconsciously “indigenous” perspectives.","title":"Comparative Political Thought","department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,2,7.5],"prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in PS or 28 MCs in SC or 28 MCs in GL/GL recognised non-language modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"PS4219","semesterData":[]}
