{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"Arabic 4 is a continuation of Arabic 3. In this module, all skills of the language are equally dealt with. Further emphasis is placed on studentsâ ability to communicate\nmore fluently. More authentic language situations are brought into the classroom and used as language models. Students are asked to personalize these situations, putting into practice newly acquired vocabulary and structures. To consolidate the studentsâ\nlearning of new vocabulary and structures, they are asked to write compositions on a variety of topics in a way that match their linguistic ability.","title":"Arabic 4","department":"Centre for Language Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[4,0,0,3,3],"prerequisite":"Successful completion of LAR3201 or exemption from it\nbased on placement test results.","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"LAR3202","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS3-0307","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":25},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS4-0602","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":25}]}],"prereqTree":"LAR3201","fulfillRequirements":["LAR4201"]}
