{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"The oriental â as figure, setting, story and / or acting style â has played varied roles in theatre histories. This module investigates archival materials, modes of transmission and Avant-Garde theatres, to study key aesthetics and ideas through which imaginings of the oriental were secreted in and by English and European theatrical performances from the 18th to the 20th centuries. The workings of orientalism will provide a vantage point from Asia for reviewing constructions of theatre history, and analysing historical issues in performance.","title":"Theatre and Orientalism","department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,2,5],"prerequisite":"TS1101E Introduction to Theatre and Performance","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"TS3248","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1500","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS7-0102","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":50}]}],"prereqTree":"TS1101E"}
