{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"ESP2104","description":"This is the sequel to PC2131 Electricity & Magnetism I, leading to the objective of understanding classical electrodynamics. Most of the examples presented require a certain degree of mathematical manipulation, as compared to a first course in electricity and magnetism. It covers the following topics: conservation laws, electromagnetic waves in vacuum and in matter, guided waves, the\npotential formulation, Lienard-Wiechert potentials, dipole radiation, radiation from point charges, special relativity, relativistic mechanics and relativistic electrodynamics.","title":"Electricity & Magnetism II","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","workload":[3,1,0,1,5],"prerequisite":"PC2131","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PC3231","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S16-0436","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":60},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S16-0436","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":60}],"examDate":"2019-12-03T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"prereqTree":"PC2131","fulfillRequirements":["EE5440","PC4262","PC4242"]}
