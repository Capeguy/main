{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This class investigates the evolutionary and developmental origins of human morality and bigotry, examining the roles of culture and of hominidsâ evolutionary history in shaping our social thoughts, actions, emotions and preferences. We will explore recent scientific findings and theories, including research with human infants, children and adults, comparative work with other species, cross cultural and anthropological findings, and evolutionary theory as it relates to the topics under investigation. The aims are to gain a better understanding of the foundations of our social natures, including human cooperation & altruism, our social preferences, and our (ingroup-biased) tribal natures.","title":"The Origins of Morality and Bigotry","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,0,9.5],"prerequisite":"YSS2201 Understanding Behavior and Cognition","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSS4255","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1030","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-CR9","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1030","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-CR9","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18}]}],"prereqTree":"YSS2201"}
