{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module examines the impact of new media content in health communication, particularly theories and concepts about health behavior outcomes, and strategic use of media channels for interventions in an environment of user‐generated media and blogs. It examines the implications for public health of profound changes in the media marketplace, including the shift from unidirectional, expert‐controlled communication to consumer‐initiated and interactive communication; the growth of social networking, and the proliferation of media sources. It focuses on how new media can be leveraged to build grassroots engagement, promote policy advocacy, and build environments that are supportive of healthy behavior change.","title":"New Media in Health Communication","department":"Communications and New Media","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,4,0,4,4.5],"prerequisite":"Cohort 2011 and before\nCompleted 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in NM, with a minimum CAP of 3.50 or be on the Honours track.\n\nCohort 2012 onwards\nCompleted 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in NM or 28MCs in GL/GL recognised nonlanguage modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"NM4219","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS6-0212","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":40}]}]}
