Comprising qualitative and quantitative elements, this module will hone students’ ability to engage in Systems Thinking: understanding parts of a system, seeing interconnections, asking ‘what-if’ questions, quantifying the\neffects of specific interventions and using such understanding to propose operational/structural policies courageously and creatively.
