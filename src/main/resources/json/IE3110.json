{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"DSC3221","description":"This course introduces students to the basic concepts of discrete-event simulation systems and application to problems that have no closed-form solutions. The course will cover modeling techniques, random number generators, discrete-event simulation approaches, simulated data analysis, simulation variance reduction techniques and state-of-the-art simulation software. At the end of this course, students will be able to analyze and develop simulation models of given problems.","title":"Simulation","department":"Industrial Systems Engineering and Management","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[3,1,0.5,4,4],"prerequisite":"IE2100 or DSC3215","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"IE3110","aliases":["IE3110R"],"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT2","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT2","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":20},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1100","endTime":"1300","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT2","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20}],"examDate":"2019-12-03T09:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"prereqTree":{"or":["IE2100","DSC3215"]}}
