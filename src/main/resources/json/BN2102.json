{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This course will introduce concepts relevant to the interpretation and statistical analysis of experimental results in the bioengineering field. Theoretical explanations will be followed by hands-on tutorials with relevant computational software. Students will learn how to perform some of the most commonly used statistical analysis of experiments (e.g., z and t tests, ANOVA analysis) as well\nas to interpret the results of typical bioengineering experiments by building a suitably fitted mathematical model.","title":"Bioengineering Data Analysis","department":"Biomedical Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[2,2,0,2,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"BN2102","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT7","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":160},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"EA-02-11","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40},{"classNo":"4","startTime":"1100","endTime":"1300","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"EA-06-03","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1100","endTime":"1300","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"EA-02-11","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"EA-06-03","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40}],"examDate":"2020-05-04T05:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"fulfillRequirements":["IE2130","IE2100","IE3101","IE4211","SPH3101"]}
