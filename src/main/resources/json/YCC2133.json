{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This 5 MC course explores basic principles, knowledge, and techniques broadly relevant to science through an integrated approach. A number of tracks will be available to choose from, and of these the student will select two. Although each track may have the flavour of a particular field, it will focus on common foundational themes that cut broadly across Science: information and entropy; shape and symmetry; recursion and emergence; equilibrium and stability; conservation laws. The course will lead from these themes to solutions of problems that require multidisciplinary approaches.","title":"Integrated Science 2","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,2,0,7.5],"prerequisite":"YCC1132 Integrated Science \nSuccessful completion of Year 1 YaleâNUS College Core Curriculum including IS1, or by permission of instructors.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YCC2133","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":"YCC1132","fulfillRequirements":["YSC3209"]}
