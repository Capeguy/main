{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"EN2204","description":"Genre consideration is important to film studies. It enables us to assess the ways in which a director works with or deviates from conventional audience  expectations, to consider how a particular film is distinctive from other films whose generic features it reiterates, etc. This module focuses on the “horror genre” to introduce students to the significance of genre analysis in film studies. Invoking this specific genre, students analyze (a) the relationship between film and popular culture; (b) academic debates around the production, meaning, experience, and consumption of “texts”; and (c) film’s commentary on issues of identity, ideology, gender, and sexuality.","title":"Reading the Horror Film","department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,0,7],"prerequisite":"EN2203","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"EN3248","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":"EN2203"}
