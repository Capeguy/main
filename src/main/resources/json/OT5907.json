{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module is concerned with the design of offshore\nstructures and elements including fixed and floating offshore\nstructures, like semi-submersibles, FPSOs, spar platforms,\nfloating jack-up structures and elements such as reinforced\n(hull) plating and mooring turntables. Topsides design\nprinciples, key hydrodynamic effects and environmental\nloading will be highlighted. Important concepts such as the\ndesign process, construction and installations requirements\nand interactions among platform elements are introduced.\nAlso covered are the methods of analysis and criteria in\ndesign such as stability, wave loading and motion in waves,\n(dynamic) positioning, mooring system components,\nstructural strength and fatigue, and design safety\nassessment codes.","title":"Design of Offshore Structures","department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[3,1.5,0.5,0,2.5],"moduleCredit":"3","moduleCode":"OT5907","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[4,5],"venue":"E1-06-05","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":36},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[3],"venue":"E3-06-07","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":36},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1600","weeks":[3,4],"venue":"E3-06-09","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":36},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1600","weeks":[3],"venue":"E3-06-07","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":36},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[3,4],"venue":"E3-06-09","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":36},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[4,5],"venue":"E3-06-07","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":36},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[5],"venue":"E3-06-09","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":36},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1600","weeks":[4],"venue":"E1-06-05","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":36},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1600","weeks":[4,5],"venue":"E1-06-07","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":36},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1600","weeks":[4,5],"venue":"E3-06-05","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":36},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[4],"venue":"E1-06-16","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":36},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[4,5],"venue":"EA-06-04","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":36},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1600","weeks":[4,5],"venue":"EA-06-07","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":36}]}]}
