{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This course covers various basic and selected advanced topics in wireless communication. It begins with an overview of current wireless systems and standards, followed by a mathematical characterization of the wireless channel. It then examines the fundamental capacity limits of wireless channels and the\ncharacteristics of the capacity-achieving transmission strategies. This part is followed by practical digital modulation techniques and their performance under wireless channel impairments, including diversity techniques to compensate for flat-fading, multicarrier modulation to combat frequency-selective fading, and multiple antenna space-time communications. The course concludes with a discussion of various practical multiple access schemes in wireless cellular systems.","title":"Wireless Communications (Advanced)","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[3,0,0,3,4],"prerequisite":"EE5137/EE5137R or EE5306","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"EE6131","attributes":{"grsu":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E3-06-04","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":45}],"examDate":"2019-12-03T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"prereqTree":{"or":["EE5137","EE5137R","EE5306"]}}
