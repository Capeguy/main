{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"How is social welfare organised in East Asia? What are the unique strengths and vulnerabilities? This course examines the origins, structure, and performance of social welfare systems in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and Korea, and analyses their distinctiveness relative to the mature welfare states of Europe and other developed economies. Students will be trained to combine major theoretical perspectives such as developmentalism, neoliberalism, and welfare regimes with empirical understanding of country cases using a critical and comparative approach.","title":"Social Welfare in East Asia","department":"LKYSPP Dean's Office","faculty":"LKY School of Public Policy","workload":[3,0,0,3,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PP5150","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1700","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LKY_SR3-4","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":90}]}]}
