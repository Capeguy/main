{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"The use of Sabahâs coastal area is examined to give an understanding of the conflicts that result in environmental quality decline and coastal habitat\ndegradation. These compromise coastal sustainability, which has serious implications for the wellâbeing of coastal communities, particularly with\nthe added impact of climate change. The more effective management modes to improve coastal resilience take into consideration the biophysical, socioâeconomic, cultural and governance aspects but implementation remains a challenge. Students will visit field sites in Sabah to analyse the site-specific issues and develop suitable management responses.","title":"Sustainability of Sabah's Coastal Environment","department":"FoS Dean's Office","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"For Environmental Studies students only.","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"ENV2202","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
