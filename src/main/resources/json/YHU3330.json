{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"What we call “Hinduism” is a modern, originally Western, concept that aggregates a multiplicity of traditions as a single religious tradition. However, many Indians took on this identity and shaped it as their own, and as they did, the Bhagavad-Gītā played an important religious and political role in this emerging self-conception—as it still does today. This course examines the way in which the Gītā is implicated in the history of Hinduism as a religion, through a range of texts (letters, comics, treatises, translations) focusing on the early 20th century.","title":"Hinduism, Nationalism, and the Bhagavad Gita in the 20th  Century","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,0,9.5],"prerequisite":"Completed Year 1 and 2 Common Curriculum modules or with the permission of the instructor.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YHU3330","semesterData":[]}
