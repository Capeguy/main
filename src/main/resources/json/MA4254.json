{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"MA3235, ISE students.","description":"Discrete optimization deals with problems of maximizing or minimizing a function over a feasible region of discrete structure. These problems come from many fields like operations research, management science and computer science. The primary objective of this module is twofold: (a) to study key techniques to separate easy problems from difficult ones and (b) to use typical methods to deal with difficult problems. \n\nMajor topics: Integer programming: cutting plane techniques, branch and bound enumeration, partitioning algorithms, the fixed charge and plant location problems. Sequencing and job-shop scheduling. Vehicle routing problems.","title":"Discrete Optimization","department":"Mathematics","faculty":"Science","workload":[3,1,0,0,6],"prerequisite":"MA2215 or MA3252 or DSC3214 or DSN3701","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"MA4254","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1100","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S17-0512","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT29","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT33","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1000","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S17-0405","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30}],"examDate":"2019-12-04T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":150}],"prereqTree":{"or":["MA2215","MA3252","DSC3214","DSN3701"]}}
