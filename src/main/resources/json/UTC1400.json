{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module challenges today’s generation of students to reexamine and debate some of the foundational myths and assumptions about Singapore’s pioneer past. The timespan covers Singapore’s founding as a colonial economic “place” in 1819, the events leading to postcolonial independence in 1959–1965, and the formation of communities into a “nation”. We will focus on the interplay of global economic factors with internal social factors, and challenge students to ask how the engagement of communities and community leaders impacts economic development.","title":"Debating Singapore's Social and Economic History","department":"College of Alice and Peter Tan","faculty":"Residential College","workload":[0,3,0,3,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"UTC1400","semesterData":[]}
