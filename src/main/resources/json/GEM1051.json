{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"GES1008","description":"This module examines policies and programmes dealing with ethnic relations based on the experiences of Singapore and Malaysia. It focuses on how these much talked about and debated policies, impact or affect the Malays in particular, who constitute a numerical minority in Singapore, but form the majority in Malaysia. The module examines major socioâhistorical factors\nconditioning these policies and programmes and the processes by which they are materialised from the period of British colonialism to the present. How these efforts bear upon nation building and national integration will be explored.","title":"Ethnicity and Nation-Building: Singapore and Malaysia","department":"Malay Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,0,7],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"GEM1051","attributes":{"su":true},"aliases":["GES1008"],"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT12","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":4},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS7-0106","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":1},{"classNo":"D2","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"AS3-0212","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":1},{"classNo":"E2","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS3-0214","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":1},{"classNo":"D1","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"AS3-0306","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":1}]},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT12","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":4},{"classNo":"D1","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"AS3-0303","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":1},{"classNo":"D2","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"AS1-0302","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":1},{"classNo":"E2","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS3-0215","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":1},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS3-0215","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":1}]}]}
