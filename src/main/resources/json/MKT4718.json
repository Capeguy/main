{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"MKT4422 The Business of Happiness","description":"This module first provides an inter-disciplinary perspective on the definition and measurement of happiness and related social constructs such as subjective wellbeing and quality of life. Building on this foundation, various broad themes of inquiry will be discussed such as the economics of happiness, positive psychology and happiness, consuming for happiness, and happiness in the workplace. Using readings from academia and the popular press, we will explore the applications of happiness concepts in business and management contexts, how they enable individuals and communities to thrive, and how this eventually makes good business sense.","title":"The Business of Happiness","department":"Marketing","faculty":"NUS Business School","workload":[0,3,0,3,4],"prerequisite":"MKT1705 Principles of Marketing","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"MKT4718","aliases":["MKT4422"],"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"A1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1500","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"BIZ1-0202","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":40}]}],"prereqTree":"MKT1705"}
