{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"TM2122, TME3122, ME2143","description":"This course covers the key concepts related to the different modes of heat transfer (conduction, convection and radiation) and principles of heat exchangers. It develops the studentsâ proficiency in applying these heat transfer concepts and principles, to analyse and solve practical engineering problems involving heat transfer processes. Topics include introduction to heat transfer; steady state heat conduction; transient heat conduction; lumped capacitance; introduction to convective heat transfer; external forced convection; internal forced convection; natural/free convection; blackbody radiation and radiative properties; radiative exchange between surfaces; introduction to heat exchangers and basic calculation of overall heat transfer coefficient.","title":"Heat Transfer","department":"SCALE Dean's Office","faculty":"Cont and Lifelong Education","workload":[3,0.5,0.5,1.5,4.5],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"ME3122E","aliases":["TME3122"],"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1800","endTime":"1900","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT7","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":5},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1800","endTime":"1900","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E3-06-03","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":5},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1800","endTime":"1900","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E3-06-10","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":5},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1900","endTime":"2130","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT7","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":15},{"classNo":"4","startTime":"1800","endTime":"1900","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E3-06-11","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":5}],"examDate":"2020-05-04T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"fulfillRequirements":["ME4223E","TME4223","TME4225","ME4225E"]}
