{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"In order to better understand civic communication, many scholars have turned to the concept of the “public sphere”: the space in society where political decisions can be debated openly to affect change.  This course explores theories of the public sphere and considers significant debates.  Is the public sphere inherently democratic or is it exclusionary?  Do modern media contribute to healthy public discussion or do they distort public communication?  Has the Internet created a powerful new “digital” public or has it polarized political dialogue?  We will discuss these questions and more with reference to historical and contemporary examples of public communications.","title":"Media, Rhetoric, and the Public Sphere","department":"Communications and New Media","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,3,6.5],"prerequisite":"Cohort 2012 onwards:\nComplete 80MCs, including 28MCs in NM or 28MCs in GL/GL\nrecognised non-language modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or\nbe on the Honours track.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"NM4881D","semesterData":[]}
