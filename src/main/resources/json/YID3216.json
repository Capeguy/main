{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"Asia is known for its fast-paced economic growth and dramatic scenes of environmental devastation. This course explores societal perception, anxiety, and action in response to environmental change and economic development in the region. How do some communities resist environmentally controversial development projects, and why do others embrace these projects? How do non-governmental organisations bridge âWesternâ ideas about environmental human rights with their own cultural traditions? And how have experts, artists, and businesses joined the action? We explore these questions through historical and contemporary case studies that illuminate the ongoing debate about economic development versus environmental sustainability in Asia.","title":"Environment, Development and Mobilisation in Asia","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,3,6.5],"prerequisite":"YID1201 Introduction to Environmental Studies or with the permission of the instructor.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YID3216","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1430","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-CR4","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1430","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-CR4","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18}],"examDate":"2020-04-28T05:00:00.000Z","examDuration":180}],"prereqTree":"YID1201"}
