{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"UTC3101","description":"The Independent Study Module provides an opportunity for students who are staying at Tembusu College for a third year to do some independent \ncritical reading or research work. Unlike a UROP, where the student contributes to an existing research project, an ISM is an individual study\nprogramme conceptualized by the student. ISMs undertaken at Tembusu College must be interdisciplinary, multi‐disciplinary, or trans‐disciplinary in\ntopic and/or approach. Student and supervisor need to submit for approval an ISM contract that gives a clear account of the topic, programme of study,\nevaluation, and other pertinent details. The ISM is a graded module.","title":"Independent Study","department":"Tembusu College","faculty":"Residential College","workload":[0,0,0,0,10],"prerequisite":"Ideally, a student should have completed the University Town Residential Programme of five modules before pursuing Independent Study. However, due to the diverse student population at Tembusu, the prerequisite is that students should\nhave completed at least one Senior Seminar. This ensures that a student has gained some familiarity with the exploration of topics in an inter‐disciplinary, multi‐disciplinary or trans‐disciplinary fashion. The student should approach a College Fellow to work out an agreed topic, readings, and assignments for the module. Part of this conversation should be to specify in what sense the topic and/or approach are interdisciplinary, multi‐disciplinary or trans‐disciplinary in character. A formal ISM contract is to be submitted to the Director of Studies for approval. Evaluation is\nbased on 100% Continuous Assessment and must be worked out between the student and the supervisor prior to seeking the College’s approval. In the course\nof the semester, between 4 and 6 meetings between student and supervisor are expected. The student is expected to play an active role in setting the agenda\nand preparing for these meetings.","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"GEM3900","semesterData":[]}
