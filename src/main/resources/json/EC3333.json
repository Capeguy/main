{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This course is designed to introduce students to certain areas of financial economics. It attempts to develop a theoretical foundation for choice under uncertainty, portfolio analysis and equilibrium asset pricing models. A considerable portion of the course will also be devoted to the fixed-income securities and derivative securities. Since this is an economics course in a liberal arts and sciences setting, we will emphasize economic concepts whenever possible, and spend time on the intellectual and economic development of investment analysis.","title":"Financial Economics I","department":"Economics","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,2,5],"prerequisite":"EC2101 AND (EC2102 OR BSP2001) AND (EC2104 OR ANY MA MODULE THAT IS NOT MA1301/MA1301FC/MA1301X OR MA1311 OR MA1312 OR MA1421)","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"EC3333","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"W03","startTime":"1700","endTime":"1800","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"W05","startTime":"1100","endTime":"1200","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS2-0510","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"W06","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1300","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS2-0510","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT8","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150},{"classNo":"W01","startTime":"1500","endTime":"1600","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS3-0212","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"W04","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1100","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS2-0510","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"W02","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1700","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS3-0212","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25}],"examDate":"2019-11-30T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"W05","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1500","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS8-0402","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"W04","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1700","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS3-0302","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"W02","startTime":"1100","endTime":"1200","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS2-0509","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"W07","startTime":"1100","endTime":"1200","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS2-0510","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":175},{"classNo":"W01","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1100","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"W03","startTime":"1500","endTime":"1600","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS3-0302","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"W06","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1100","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS2-0510","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25}]}]}
