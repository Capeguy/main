{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module introduces students to contemporary debates in population from a geographical perspective, focusing on the ways that geography is implicated in the processes and meanings of life and death. Besides examining historical and contemporary population trends and demographic transitions, this module also investigates the discourses and politics of fertility and womenâs bodies, migration and transnational life, disease and healthâcare, and ageing, death and dying. The module enables students to think critically about contemporary population problems and solutions and to understand how these influence policy formulation and everyday lives. This module is open to all students who are interested in population issues from a social science perspective.","title":"Geographies of Life and Death","department":"Geography","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,2,5],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"GE2206","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT9","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100},{"classNo":"E3","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS2-0203","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS2-0203","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"E4","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS2-0203","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25}],"examDate":"2019-11-28T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}]}
