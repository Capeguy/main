{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"What are the social and economic determinants of health? How do meanings of ‘health’ differ across populations and communities? This module adopts a multi-disciplinary approach in examining the different understandings of ‘health’ in society, via thinking critically about real-world health issues and their management. Drawing from disciplines such as medical anthropology, urban sociology and human geography, students will investigate how ‘health’ implicates – and is implicated by – the lives of individuals and societies. This module explores contemporary technological, ethical, political and cultural debates in health, healing and well-being, and is open to students from all disciplines and backgrounds.","title":"Social Determinants of Health","department":"SSH School of Public Health Dean's Office","faculty":"SSH School of Public Health","workload":[3,0,0,3,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"SPH2107","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"MD1-08-03E","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40}]},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"MD1-08-03E","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40}]}]}
