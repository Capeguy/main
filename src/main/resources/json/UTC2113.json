This module investigates the idea of ‘the game’ to develop an appreciation of gaming life. Games are explored in theoretical and practical ways to develop questions interrelating technology, culture, and human community. Further investigation explores gaming culture, i.e.:strategy, tactics, entanglement, addiction, pleasure, play; and domains such as ‘political’ and ‘academic’ games. Play and practice are central features. Students will engage in the construction, critique, and development of games, applying concepts to broader issues of public concern related to the production of social form.","title":"Gaming Life","department":"Tembusu College","faculty":"Residential College","workload":[0,3,0,3,4],"prerequisite":"GEM1902% or GEM1912% or UTC11%","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"UTC2113","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"TC-SR4","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":16},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1500","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"TC-SR4","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":16},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1300","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"TC-SR4","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":16}]}],"prereqTree":{"or":["GEM1902","GEM1912"]}}
