{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"The course will consider, side by side, certain `philosophical' works of literature and more orthodox philosophical works.  The idea is to explore the ways and degrees to which it makes sense - also, the ways and degrees to which it does not make sense - to say that this work of fiction (a novel, say) is really about the same thing that this philosophical text is about.  Turning the point around:  when philosophers - like Plato or Nietzsche - employ literary techniques more characteristic of fiction, what philosophical work is hereby done?","title":"Philosophy and Literature","department":"Philosophy","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,0,7],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PH3214","semesterData":[]}
