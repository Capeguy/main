{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"The idea that ‘pragmatism’ accounts for Singapore’s successful development and governance is at the heart of the Singapore model. But its practical meaning – even in the most seemingly technocratic policy examples – has been multiple, unstable, contradictory, and increasingly ideological in an age of neoliberal globalization, when the market often gets to dictate what counts as pragmatic, and often in ways that obscure and thus secure elite interests. This module explores the policy and legislative debates surrounding: (1) Sex, including prostitution, homosexuality,\nand procreation; (2) Addiction, including drug use, gambling, and smoking; and (3) Censorship of the arts and popular culture.","title":"Pragmatism and Public Morality in Singapore","department":"LKYSPP Dean's Office","faculty":"LKY School of Public Policy","workload":[3,0,0,3,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PP5518","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1700","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LKY_TB10SR","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":90}]}]}
