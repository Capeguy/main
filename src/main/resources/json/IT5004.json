{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"IS2102","description":"This module aims to equip non-computing students with fundamental knowledge in architecting and designing modern Enterprise Systems in organisations that can be reasonably complex, scalable, distributed, component-based and missioncritical. Students will develop an understanding of high-level concepts such as enterprise architecture and software architecture. They will them move on to acquire fundamental systems analysis and design techniques such as object-oriented requirements analysis and design using the Unified Modelling Language.","title":"Enterprise Systems Architecture Fundamentals","department":"Information Systems and Analytics","faculty":"Computing","workload":[2,1,0,3,4],"corequisite":"IT5001","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"IT5004","attributes":{"lab":true,"ssgf":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1830","endTime":"2130","weeks":{"start":"2020-01-16","end":"2020-04-16"},"venue":"SR_LT19","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":45}]}]}
