{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"GEM3902","description":"The Independent Study Module (ISM) provides an opportunity for senior undergraduates who are staying at the College of Alice & Peter Tan (CAPT) to do \nindependent critical reading or research work. Unlike a UROP, where the student contributes to an existing research project, an ISM is an individual study \nprogramme conceptualized by the student. ISMs undertaken at CAPT must be inter-disciplinary, multidisciplinary, or trans-disciplinary in topic and/or approach. \nStudent and supervisor need to submit for approval an ISM contract that gives a clear account of the topic, programme of study, evaluation, and other pertinent \ndetails. The ISM is a graded module.","title":"Independent Study","department":"College of Alice and Peter Tan","faculty":"Residential College","workload":[0,0,0,0,10],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"UTC3400","attributes":{"ism":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":1}]},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":2},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":2},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":2}]}]}
