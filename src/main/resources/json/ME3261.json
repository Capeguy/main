{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This course covers the principles of computer-aided tools: CAD and CAM, which are widely used in modern design and manufacturing industry. By introducing the mathematical background and fundamental part programming of CAD/CAM, this course provides the basics for students to understand the techniques and their industrial applications. The topics are: CAD: geometric modelling methods for curves, surfaces, and solids; CAM: part fabrication by CNC machining based on given geometric model; Basics of CNC machining; Tool path generation in CAD/CAM (Option to introduce a CAM software to generate a CNC program for the machining of a part); Verification of fabricated part by CNC measurement based on given geometric model. The module is targeted at students specializing in manufacturing engineering.","title":"Computer-Aided Design And Manufacturing","department":"Mechanical Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[3,0.5,0,2.5,4],"corequisite":"ME2162/ME3162","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"ME3261","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1100","endTime":"1300","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"ENG-AUD","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"ENG-AUD","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150}],"examDate":"2019-11-29T06:30:00.000Z","examDuration":120}]}
