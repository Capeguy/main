{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"ST5318","description":"The module introduces designed experiment as a tool for process improvements and designing products that are robust to environmental variability. Inferences about the effect of factors on a product or process can be drawn using designed experiment. Topics include analysis of variance of fixed-effect models, randomized block design, factorial designs, fractional factorial designs, blocking and confounding, response surface methodology, random effects models, nested and split-plot designs. Predictive analytics using designed experiments. This module is targeted at students who are interested in designing robust products and process improvements, and are able to meet the pre-requisites.","title":"Design of Experiments for Product Design and Process Improvements","department":"Statistics and Applied Probability","faculty":"Science","workload":[3,1,0,3,3],"prerequisite":"Departmental approval","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"ST5203","attributes":{"ssgf":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1900","endTime":"2200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT28","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150}],"examDate":"2019-11-29T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}]}
