{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"Although founded on ideals of humanism and human exceptionalism, anthropology provides a unique perspective on the nature of anthropocentrism in the Anthropocene. This course builds on key theoretical insights articulated by a range of post-humanist scholars in order to rethink the relationships between us as a species of cultured animal and a range of other species. In doing so, this course will trouble the distinction between ethnological methods, ethnographic representation, ethology, and biology to provide insight on how contemporary scholarship in the discipline provides new ways of understanding ecology, environmental activism, scientific research, medical technology and non-human animal rights.","title":"Multispecies Ethnography","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,3,6.5],"corequisite":"YCC2121 Modern Social Thought","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSS4241","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-CR2","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18}]}]}
