{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"Radio and microwave systems are used for information transmission.  This module therefore introduces the student to a broad range of enabling knowledge and skills commonly employed by RF and microwave engineers to specify, analyse and design radio and microwave transmission systems.  Topics covered:  Time-varying EM fields: guided waves, evanescent modes and plane-wave propagation. Radiation: radiation mechanism, magnetic vector potential, current distribution on a thin wire, Hertzian dipole, Half-wave dipole & monopole. RF Antennas: parameters, aperture antennas and arrays.  RF Amplification: stability, gain and small-signal narrowband design.  RF Generation:  conditions for oscillation, oscillator design and dielectric resonators.   RF Receivers:  receiver and mixer parameters.  RF Systems: system gain and noise figure, satellite and terrestrial systems.","title":"RF Communications","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[2.5,0.5,0.5,2,4.5],"prerequisite":"PC2020","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"EE4101","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E3-06-05","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Packaged Lecture","size":30},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E3-06-05","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Packaged Tutorial","size":30}],"examDate":"2019-11-26T05:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"prereqTree":"PC2020","fulfillRequirements":["EE5801","EE5303"]}
