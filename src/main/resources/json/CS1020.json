It continues the introduction that begins in CS1010, and emphasises objectoriented programming with application to simple data structures. Topics include object-oriented problem modeling with objects, classes and methods, object-oriented problem formulation and solving, data structure implementation strageties, abstraction and encapsulation of data structures, object-oriented programming constructs, APIs and class libraries, exception handling, lists, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables and their algorithmic design, sorting and searching methods, recursive algorithms, and Big-O notation. This module is appropriate for SoC and FoS students.","title":"Data Structures and Algorithms I","department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","workload":[2,1,1,3,3],"prerequisite":"CS1010 Programming Methodology","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"CS1020","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[],"prereqTree":"CS1010","fulfillRequirements":["CS5239","CS5240","CS5249","CS5241","CS3218","CS2010","CS2104","CS3240","CS2108","CS4243","CS2102","CS2103","CS2105","CS2103T","CS2220","CS2102R","CS3221","IS4302","IS3261","BT3102","IS2150","IS2103","IS2102","CG2271"]}
