{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"With particular focus on the works of Julian Barnes, JM Coetzee, William Boyd, and Don DeLillo, this module explores how these contemporary novelists get around the problem of the “death of the author,” surpassing even reader-response theory, and transforming narratives into a question of what we will call “reader responsibility.” Through analyses of DeLillo’s Cosmopolis, Barnes’s Sense of an Ending, Coetzee’s Childhood of Jesus, and Boyd’s Any Human Heart, this module examines how these novelists effectively make readers complicit with narrative developments.","title":"Reader-Responsibility","department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,0,7],"prerequisite":"(i) EN1101E or GEK1000, AND (ii) at least one of the following modules (EN2201, EN2202, EN2203, EN2204, EN2205, EN2207)","corequisite":"So long as students have fulfilled EN1101E/GEK1000, they may take this EN level-3000 module in the same semester as they are taking one of the following  modules (EN2201, EN2202, EN2203, EN2204, EN2205, EN2207).","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"EN3880B","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1500","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS4-0206","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":50}]}],"prereqTree":{"and":[{"or":["EN1101E","GEK1000"]},{"or":["EN2201","EN2202","EN2203","EN2204","EN2205","EN2207"]}]}}
