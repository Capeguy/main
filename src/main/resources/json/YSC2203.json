{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"The course discusses the principles of classical mechanics within a rigorous mathematical framework. Topics may include kinematics, conservative forces, central-force motion, small oscillations, rigid bodies, variational problems, the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms, non-inertial frames, and special relativity. This course is a prerequisite for most of the Major modules in Physics.","title":"Classical Mechanics","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,4,0,0,8.5],"prerequisite":"YSC1213 General Physics and YSC1216 Calculus or with the permission of the instructor.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSC2203","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1030","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-CR23","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1030","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-CR23","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1300","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-CR23","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18}],"examDate":"2020-04-28T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":180}],"prereqTree":{"and":["YSC1213","YSC1216"]},"fulfillRequirements":["YSC3210","YSC4223","YSC4222","YSC3246"]}
