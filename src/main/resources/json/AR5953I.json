{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"The design of a building faรงade is increasingly an artistic expression, driven by performance issues that are no longer considered simply uniform. Generative design approaches strongly support this combination of artistic and performance-based design. This course focuses on spatial and shape grammars as a generative approach and considers Processing as a development environment. The objective of this course is to introduce students to spatial grammars (in particular, shape grammars) and their application to faรงade design and to Processing as a programming environment. Formal and informal aspects of grammars, evolution of grammatical ideas, application of a grammatical approach to faรงade design and its implementation in Processing will be emphasized.","title":"Topics in Design Technology Faรงade Rules, Spatial Grammars and Processing","department":"Architecture","faculty":"Design and Environment","workload":[1,1,0,2,6],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"AR5953I","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1700","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"SDE-ER4","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":20}]}]}
