{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"Why do certain societies succeed, while others fail? While some countries in East Asia such as Singapore and South Korea have achieved economic success, others in the Middle East (or ‘West Asia’) have undergone a trend of de-development, evident in the post-‘Arab Spring’social unrest . This module explores the contrasting social and economic development models of Asia’s regions. We will explore how states are formed, different economic strategies countries have pursued, weigh the impact of culture, and examine social deprivation and autocratic leadership. We uncover the deep-rooted social and economic reasons behind successful or failed development in different Asian countries.","title":"Emerging Asia: Successes and Challenges","department":"College of Alice and Peter Tan","faculty":"Residential College","workload":[0,2,0,3,5],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"UTC2405","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"CAPT-SR3","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":15},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[2,4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"ERC-SR9CAM","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":15},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[2,4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"ERC-SR9CAM","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":15},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"CAPT-SR3","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":15}]}]}
