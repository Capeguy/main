{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"The aim of this research tutorial is to use a specific DNA sequencing technology to study the urban wildlife in Singapore. In this research tutorial students will learn basic molecular genetic skills that they can apply to any modern genetic study, including DNA isolation, PCR, gel electrophoresis, etc. They will also learn skills specific to the technology in question. Students will collect non-invasive samples in and around Singapore and apply the skills they learned with the goal of being able to identify species and sex from DNA sequence collected. The focus of this project is genetic; however, students may have the opportunity to collect and analyse other forms of data related to Singaporeâs wildlife. The aim of the proposed research is to develop a protocol for broader use.","title":"Research Tutorial: DNA and Urban Wildlife","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,0,3,3,6],"prerequisite":"YCC1122 Quantitative Reasoning, YCC1131Scientific Inquiry 1 and YCC2137 Scientific Inquiry 2.","corequisite":"YCC2137 Scientific Inquiry 2","moduleCredit":"2","moduleCode":"YSC2250","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-LSciLab","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":10}]}],"prereqTree":{"and":["YCC1122","YCC1131S","YCC2137"]}}
