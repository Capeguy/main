{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"The main objective of this course is to cover advanced topics in concrete and cementitious composites. Focus will be placed on special cementâbased materials that are fast replacing traditional normal density, low strength concrete in the construction industry, especially precast and repair and retrofit. More specifically special concretes and special processes and technology for particular types of structures are discussed. Case studies will used to illustrate construction and sustainability issues. Use of concrete and cementitious composites in a number of applications will also be covered.","title":"Concrete and Cementitious Composites","department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[1,0,0,0.5,3.5],"moduleCredit":"2","moduleCode":"CE5610A","attributes":{"lab":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2100","weeks":[1,2],"venue":"E3-06-08","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1700","weeks":[1,2],"venue":"LT1","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2100","weeks":[4],"venue":"EA-06-06","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40}]}]}
