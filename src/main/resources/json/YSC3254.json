{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module is designed to train students to participate in mathematics research under the direction of Dave Smith in the field of partial differential equations. Students will learn some preliminary topics from Fourier analysis and Complex analysis, then learn the unified transform method. Students will be expected to demonstrate their mastery of the method by implementing it to solve some classical and new initial boundary value problems. Students will also learn how to use modern techniques for collaborative research, including git and team task tracking. Students will be prepared for a number of summer research projects with funding available.","title":"Research Tutorial: Unified Transform Method","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,4,0,4,2],"prerequisite":"YSC2209 Proof and YSC2232 Linear Algebra","moduleCredit":"2","moduleCode":"YSC3254","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":{"and":["YSC2209","YSC2232"]}}
