{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This course embarks on a deep study of the real numbers and functions of a\nsingle real variable. Fundamental properties of real numbers â arithmetic,\ndistance, limit, convergence, order â are developed from scratch. From\nthere, the course delves into the inner workings of calculus, the general\nnotions of continuity, differentiability, measure, and integration, for\nfunctions of one real variable.","title":"Introduction to Real Analysis","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,4,0,0,8.5],"prerequisite":"YSC2209 Proof OR YSC2232 Linear Algebra","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSC3206","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1030","endTime":"1230","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-CR20","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1030","endTime":"1230","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-CR20","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18}],"examDate":"2019-12-02T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":180}],"prereqTree":{"or":["YSC2209","YSC2232"]},"fulfillRequirements":["YSC4210","YSC4201A","YSC4206","YSC4203"]}
