{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"What does “Chinese” mean when we talk about “Chinese” language, “Chinese” culture or “Chinese” people? What is “Chinese-ness”, and what is the anthropolinguistic evidence for this? The issues and topics covered in this module will help us to address these questions. These include interpersonal communication between “Chinese” people themselves (“intracultural communication”); between “Chinese” people and other “non-Chinese” peoples (“intercultural communication”); and, between selected groups of “Chinese” people. This module covers a wide range of interesting real-life scenarios involving anthropological, linguistic, psychological and communicative evidence. Students will find practical use for the knowledge acquired in this module.","title":"Chinese Anthropolinguistics (taught in English)","department":"Chinese Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,2,5],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"CL2291","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1500","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS3-0303","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30}]}]}
