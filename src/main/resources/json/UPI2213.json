{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"The rule of Britain, France and the Netherlands in the 18th-20th centuries have left behind a conflicting legacy in different parts of Asia. On the one hand, they destroyedâeven if only partiallyâthe cultural traditions as well as socio-economic infrastructure of their colonies. On the other, they established political, economic, social and cultural institutions that colonialized subjects have to different degrees benefitted from till this day.
