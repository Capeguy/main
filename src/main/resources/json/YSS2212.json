We will analyse theoretical models of imperfectly competitive markets to gain insights into firmsâ behaviour and functioning of real-world markets.","title":"Firms' Strategies and Market Competition","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,5,4.5],"prerequisite":"YSS2203 Intermediate Microeconomics","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSS2212","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":"YSS2203"}
