{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"The objective of this module is to introduce the principal ideas behind program compilation, and discusses various techniques for program parsing, program analysis, program optimisation, and run-time organisation required for program execution. Topics covered include regular expressions, context-free grammars, lexical analysis, syntax analysis; different algorithms for parsing codes, such as top-down parsing, bottom-up parsing; translation to abstract syntax using modern parser generator technology, intermediate representation, semantics analysis, type system, un-optimised code generation, code optimisation, data-flow analysis, instruction scheduling.","title":"Compiler Design","department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","workload":[2,1,0,3,3],"prerequisite":"CS2104 Programming Language","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"CS4212","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1700","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"SR_LT19","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":48},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1500","endTime":"1700","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"SR_LT19","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":48}],"examDate":"2019-11-28T05:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"prereqTree":"CS2104","fulfillRequirements":["CS6215","CS5214","CS5271","CS5218","CS6202"]}
