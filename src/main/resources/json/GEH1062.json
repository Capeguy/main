{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"Ghosts  and  spirits  have  been  subjects  of  perennial interest in different human societies. At the same time, beliefs  about  persons  with  powers  to  initiate  injury  or  good,  and  their  relationship  with  spirits  are  found  in  almost all cultures   throughout   human   history.   This module  introduces  students  to  the  scholarly  study  of  ghosts  and  spirits,  and  the  specialists  and  practitioners  involved  with  these  forces.  These  include  shamanism,  spirit  possession,  witchcraft  and  sorcery,  and  other  supernatural  entities  such  as  zombies,  vampires  and  werewolves,  and  how  these  intersect  with  issues  of  class,  gender,  sexuality,  ethnicity,  citizenship,  popular  culture, modernity and social change.","title":"Ghosts and Spirits in Society and Culture","department":"Sociology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,2,5],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"GEH1062","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT14","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150},{"classNo":"D1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"AS7-0119","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"E3","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS1-0208","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"D4","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"AS8-0402","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"E4","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS1-0201","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS5-0202","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"D3","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"AS7-0119","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25}],"examDate":"2019-12-02T05:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}]}
