{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This course will be an introduction to Riemann surfaces, focusing on topics such as topology of Riemann surfaces, divisors and line bundles, differential forms and Hodge theory, the Riemann-Roch theorem, period mappings, the PoincarĂŠ-Koebe uniformisation theorem. We will also discuss more advanced topics such as algebraic curves, hyperbolic geometry and discrete groups of automorphisms.","title":"Riemann Surfaces","department":"Mathematics","faculty":"Science","workload":[3,0,0,0,7],"prerequisite":"MA4247 or departmental approval","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"MA5253","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S17-0511","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":15},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S17-0511","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":15}],"examDate":"2019-12-06T06:30:00.000Z","examDuration":150}],"prereqTree":"MA4247"}
