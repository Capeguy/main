{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This course explores approaches to adapting and staging of Shakespeare for contemporary audience to develop an understanding of the creative processes and implications involved. Through seminar discussions and practical creative work, we will examine creative, cultural and ethical implications of returning, repeating, rewriting, reinterpreting and representing. Selected contemporary performances of Shakespeare will be studied in the first part of the course to provide a basis for critical discussion and creative referencing. Students will then produce a creative proposal based on a selected Shakespeare play, for which they will rework for presentation towards the end of the course.","title":"Adapting Shakespeare","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,0,9.5],"prerequisite":"New 2000 level course on Thinking about Performance Making.
