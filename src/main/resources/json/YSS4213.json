These strategies respond to diverse\nsocial, cultural, and institutional contexts, revealing varied interpretations\nof what communities are and what resources and capacities are necessary\nfor their development. In particular, we will explore the hypothesis that\ncommunity development can be understood as the villagization of the\nurban. We will use this investigation to inform a semester-long\nengagement with a community in Singapore to understand the challenges\nand opportunities that community members face. This engagement will be \naimed at the collaborative formulation of proposals aimed at strengthening\nthe community.","title":"Community Development: In Search of the Kampung Spirit","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,10,3],"prerequisite":"YSS3245 Key Debates in Urban Planning and Policy OR, YSS3222 Urban\nTheory OR, permission of the instructor","corequisite":"Current enrolment in YSS3245 Key Debates in Urban Planning and Policy OR, YSS3222 Urban Theory OR, permission of the instructor","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSS4213","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":{"and":["YSS3245","YSS3222"]}}
