{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This course focuses on the extension of calculus to smooth functions of many\nvariables. A geometric approach leads to a treatment of regions in n-dimensional space, smooth functions and their derivatives, differential\nforms, cycles, and integration. This course may be suitable for students\nseeking advanced study in mathematics for physics or economics.","title":"Advanced Calculus","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,4.5,0,4,4],"prerequisite":"YSC2209 Proof (or permission of instructor)\nYSC2232 Linear Algebra (acceptable as a coârequisite too.)","corequisite":"YSC2232 Linear Algebra","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSC3218","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":{"or":["YSC2209","YSC2232"]}}
