{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"Calculus unites the study of instantaneous rates of change, area and optimisation, via the mathematical concepts of limit and infinity. This module provides a conceptual framework for Calculus. We eschew full mathematical rigour, but emphasise real world phenomena more than the rote formal calculations that make up a typical high school Calculus class.\n\nThis module is suitable not only for those who have never learned Calculus before, but also for those who have completed a high school Calculus course. Students completing the module will be prepared for discipline-specific classes in the Sciences and Social Sciences which make use of Calculus.","title":"Calculus","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,4,0,3,5.5],"moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSC1216","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1630","endTime":"1830","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-CR15","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":45},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1630","endTime":"1830","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-CR15","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":45}],"examDate":"2019-12-04T05:00:00.000Z","examDuration":180},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1030","endTime":"1230","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-CR17","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1030","endTime":"1230","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-CR17","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18}],"examDate":"2020-05-08T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":180}],"fulfillRequirements":["YSC4216","YSC2203","YSC1213","YSC4225","YSC4227"]}
