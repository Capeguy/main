{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module aims to introduce the principles and approaches of physics in the area of molecular biophysics. It includes molecular complexes of biomolecules; physical and symmetrical relationships between biomolecules; physical and structural characteristics of proteins and amino acids; symmetric and statistical descriptions of nucleic acids; first law and second law of thermodynamics in biological systems; bonding and non-bonding potentials, and stabilizing interactions in biomacromolecules, and the correlation to macromolecular structures; molecular mechanics in biological systems; bio soft condensed materials, bio-membrane and biomembrane structure, principles of molecular self assembly of biomolecules. There is a lab component included in this module.  This module is targeted at both physics and non-physics students who already have basic knowledge in physics and life sciences.","title":"Biophysics II","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","workload":[2,1,1,2,4],"prerequisite":"Students who have passed either PC2131 or PC2267 or EE2011 or Departmental Approval","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PC3267","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"2","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[6,7,8,9],"venue":"S7-0102","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":14},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1700","weeks":[6,7,8,9],"venue":"S7-0102","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":14},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S16-0431","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":42},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[6,7,8,9],"venue":"S7-0102","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":14},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S16-0431","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":42}],"examDate":"2020-04-27T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"prereqTree":{"or":["PC2131","PC2267","EE2011"]},"fulfillRequirements":["PC4268","PC4267"]}
