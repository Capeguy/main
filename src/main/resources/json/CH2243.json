{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module is aimed at providing students with essential information on the Chinese communities in Southeast Asia and the critical ability to understand/analyse their modern transformations. It begins with the factors leading to the mass migration of Chinese to Southeast Asia in the mid-19th century and the internal structure of Chinese communities in the region. The focus is on their economic, political, cultural activities, identity transformation as well as their contributions towards the region's development since the early 20th century, especially after the end of World War II. The course will also examine the role of ethnic Chinese in the socio-cultural interactions between China and Southeast Asia.","title":"Chinese in Southeast Asia","department":"Chinese Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,3,4],"prerequisite":"Must obtain:\n1) At least a B4 for (a) Higher Chinese at GCE 'O' Level, or (b) Chinese Language at GCE 'AO' Level (at GCE 'A' Level examination); OR\n2) At least a pass for (a) Chinese at GCE 'A' Level, or (b) Higher Chinese at GCE 'A' Level; OR\n3) At least C grade for Chinese Language (H1CL) at GCE 'A' Level; OR\n4) At least a pass for (a) Chinese Language and Literature (H2CLL) at GCE 'A' Level, or (b) Chinese Language and Literature (H3CLL) at GCE 'A' Level.\n5) Equivalent qualifications may be accepted.","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"CH2243","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS3-0215","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":30}]}]}
