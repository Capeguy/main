Game theory is a set of mathematical tools used to understand strategic interactions, where one person's best course of action depends on the behavior of others. Students will become familiar with the “science” and the “art” of game theory, discussing how to solve games and how to create them to represent strategic situations and shed new light on political events. Applications are taken from international relations, with a review of the First World War, the Second World War, and the Nuclear Age.","title":"Game Theory and International Relations","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,4.5,5],"prerequisite":"Students should be familiar with basic concepts of linear algebra and probability and statistics (Bayes’ rule).","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSS2238","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1030","endTime":"1230","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-GLRm2","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1030","endTime":"1130","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-GLRm2","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18}],"examDate":"2020-05-04T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":180}]}
