{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module explores the relevance and importance of anthropological approaches toward understanding urban life using the ethnographic field method. Issues to be critically examined include the construction and production of space and place in relation to the dynamic interplay of urban structures; the politics of gender, ethnicity, consumption, work and leisure; and processes that\nâglobaliseâ cities and the urban nightlife. This module is useful for students who are interested in enhancing their analytical skills, conducting field ethnography and applying anthropology to analysing urban life.","title":"Urban Anthropology","department":"Sociology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,3,6.5],"prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in SC or 28MCs in GL/GL recognised non-language modules with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"SC4206","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1500","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS1-0212","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":45}]}]}
