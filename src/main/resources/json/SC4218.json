{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module is designed to develop a nuanced understanding of forms of religiosity in the present. One aim of the module is to explore connections between the realms of religion and politics, particularly within the framework of secular states. The module examines the notions of ‘secularity’ and ‘post‐secularity’ and queries their relevance for the contemporary moment, within a comparative, historical perspective. Is it useful to invoke the concept of ‘secularism’ to make sense of encounters between religious and political domains? Do the ideas\nof the ‘separation of church and state’ and ‘state non-interference in religion’ help in these efforts?","title":"Religions, Secularity, Post-Secularity","department":"Sociology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,3,6.5],"prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in SC, or 28 MCs in PS, or 28 MCs in GL/GL recognised non-language modules with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"SC4218","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1500","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS1-0212","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":45}]}]}
