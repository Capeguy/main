{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This course explores the cognitive, social, and emotional capacities of creatures without language or culture. How rich an inner mental life can exist without these supports, and how much of our complex psychology is unique to mature humans? We explore thought & cognition (e.g., spatial navigation, numerical cognition, tool use, problem-solving, consciousness); social life (e.g., theory of mind, social learning, communication, cooperation & altruism); and subjective experience (attachment, pain, emotional expression, emotional experience & capacity). This course is highly interdisciplinary, bringing together work from psychology (cognitive, social, developmental, and comparative), cognitive science, ethology, anthropology, and evolutionary theory.","title":"The Mental Lives of Infants and Animals","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,0,9.5],"prerequisite":"YSS2201 Understanding Behaviour and Cognition","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSS3298","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1430","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-CR21","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1430","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-CR21","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18}]}],"prereqTree":"YSS2201"}
