{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"SC4215B Citizenship, Nation and Globalization","description":"The concept of citizenship has been understood as the mechanisms through which the individual is linked to the nation, involving a variety of processes, such as rights, culture, or race.  There are new claims that with globalization, there has been the re-definition of the idea of the citizenship and the nation, leading to new concepts such as flexible citizenship and de-territorialized nation-states. This course will examine how that movement of people, capital, and ideas are affecting citizenship, and how this affects the relation between state and society. This module is mounted for students throughout NUS with interest in the concept of citizenship.","title":"Citizenship, Nation and Globalization","department":"Sociology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,3,6.5],"prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in SC, or 28MCs in PS, or 28MCs in GL/GL recognised non-language modules with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"SC4882B","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS1-0212","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":45}]}]}
