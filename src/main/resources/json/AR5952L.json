{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"In this course, students are introduced to a selection of classic texts about urban planning. How did urban planning arise as a professional, intellectual and political activity? What are the assumptions and values attached to various planning paradigms? How should one study and intervene into the city, and to what ends? The âurban questionâ has been posed since the 19th century, and we foresee new and old challenges in the future. As a reading seminar, students are taught to read critically and closely. There are three pedagogical objectives: 1. Prepare students for research and dissertation-writing; 2. Challenge students to think critically about cities by reviewing classic texts; and 3. Contribute to our awareness of the politics of planning in Singapore and around the world.","title":"Topics in Urban Studies: Politics of Planning: Histories, Theories And Challenges","department":"Architecture","faculty":"Design and Environment","workload":[0,2,0,3,5],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"AR5952L","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"SDE-ER5","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":20}]}]}
