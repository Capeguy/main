{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This course, together with Advanced Chinese 2, bridges the gap between our current offerings of intermediate and advanced-level Chinese, serving students who have completed YLC 2202 Intermediate Chinese 2 or equivalent. It continues to develop studentsâ abilities in speaking, orally comprehending, reading, and writing modern Mandarin Chinese and, concomitantly, also serves to deepen studentsâ understanding of the social and cultural issues facing China today. Students will be routinely drilled in reading and writing throughout the semester. Systematic discussion, debate, and presentation provide students with ample opportunities to practice and enhance their newly acquired linguistic skills and oral fluency.","title":"Advanced Chinese 1","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,4,0,2,6.5],"prerequisite":"YLC2202 Intermediate Chinese 2 or students who passed GCE Chinese O & A Levels (an interview or placement test may be administered.)","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YLC3203","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1430","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-CR23","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":15},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-CR23","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":15},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1430","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-CR23","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":15}],"examDate":"2020-04-29T05:00:00.000Z","examDuration":180}],"prereqTree":"YLC2202","fulfillRequirements":["YLC3204"]}
