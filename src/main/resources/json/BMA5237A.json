{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This course examines the dynamics involved in an MNE’s quest for global value chain optimization and risk management, with a focus on the Asia Pacific region. We will go beyond fundamental supply chain management and explore how other so-called “secondary” drivers influence the core “primary” drivers of international value chains.\n\nThe class will explore how information technologies are impacting IVCs, and how real-time data management, social media and other “disruptive” technologies are redefining IVCs. Students will also study economic trends and regulatory environments involving global trade and tax regime management.","title":"Topics in Managing Global Value Chains and Networks","department":"BIZ Dean's Office","faculty":"NUS Business School","workload":[2,0,0,2,1],"moduleCredit":"2","moduleCode":"BMA5237A","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"P1","startTime":"1830","endTime":"2130","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6],"venue":"","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":66}]}]}
