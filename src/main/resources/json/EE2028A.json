{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This is a first course that introduces programming in C\nlanguage. It exposes fundamental programming\nmethodologies to be followed which involves capturing the\nspecifications provided, designing and scripting a solution,\ncoding and compiling towards solving real-life complex\nproblems. Emphasis will be given on problems in\nElectrical Engineering topics. Topics in the module\ninclude, introduction to C language programming\nconstructs (variables, types, expressions, assignments,\nfunctions, arrays, structures, basic pointer operations\netc.), writing pseudo-codes, problem solving using\nElectrical Engineering applications, program development,\ncoding, testing and debugging facilitating a design\ntowards solving complex problems.","title":"C Programming","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[1,0,1,0,3],"corequisite":"CS1010E","moduleCredit":"2","moduleCode":"EE2028A","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"02","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E4-03-07","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":40},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1500","endTime":"1600","weeks":[7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT1","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"ENG-AUD","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E4-03-07","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":40}]},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1700","weeks":[3,4,5,6],"venue":"E4A-06-03","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":80},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7],"venue":"LT2","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1500","endTime":"1700","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7],"venue":"LT2","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150},{"classNo":"02","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1700","weeks":[3,4,5,6],"venue":"E4A-06-03","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":80}]}]}
