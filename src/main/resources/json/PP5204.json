{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"Writing in The New York Times, Thomas Friedman encouraged policymakers to emulate the prevailing attitude in Singapore of ‘taking governing seriously and thinking strategically’. This module is a critical exploration of the basis and implications of such a claim, focusing on features of governance in Singapore that may be viewed as unique. To achieve this, such features – particularly Singapore’s systematic attempt to manage risks and complexity – are discussed in the context of influential theories and models of governance. To bridge theory and practice, the module is team-taught by a top civil servant and a political scientist, both Singaporean.","title":"Evolving Practices of Governance in Singapore","department":"LKYSPP Dean's Office","faculty":"LKY School of Public Policy","workload":[0,3,0,4,3],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PP5204","semesterData":[]}
