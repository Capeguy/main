{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"The purpose of this course is to provide students with a ‘toolbox’ and working knowledge of advanced crosssectional and panel data econometric techniques\nfrequently used in applied microeconomic policy analysis and research. This course will cover major extensions to the standard OLS regression model and provide students with an introduction to the ‘cutting edge’ techniques used today to evaluate microeconomic theories and policies, including instrumental variables, difference-in-differences, matching estimators, regression discontinuity and quantile\nregressions. The emphasis of the course will be on estimating causal relationships that can then be used to make predictions about the consequences of changing a policy.","title":"Advanced Applied Econometrics for Policy Analysis","department":"LKYSPP Dean's Office","faculty":"LKY School of Public Policy","workload":[3,0,0,2,5],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PP5171","semesterData":[]}
