{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module explores how the contemporary structure of the global system emerged. It studies how a world economy with integrated systems of production and trade emerged from interactions in which ethnic, national, political, and cultural divisions played a crucial role. It also examines the mechanisms though which Europeans and European culture maintained a dominant place through conflicts and crises from the sixteenth century onwards. The period under investigation runs from the Thirteenth Century to the start of the Twentieth.","title":"Origins of the Modern World","department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,3,4],"prerequisite":"GL1101E","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"GL2101","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"E2","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[2,4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS4-0601","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[2,4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS1-0211","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":75},{"classNo":"D1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"AS4-0604","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25}]}],"prereqTree":"GL1101E","fulfillRequirements":["GL3202","GL3201","GL3101","GL2104"]}
