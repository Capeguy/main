{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module focuses on the interrelations between philosophy and literature in English (or in translation) from Plato to seventeenth-century natural philosophy to the modernist context. We will read a variety of philosophical and literary works, paying special attention to how philosophical ideas are articulated and interrogated in narrative. Even more specifically, we will analyse how philosophical ideals behave in literary contexts and how these ideals filter into the lives of ordinary people (including critics, authors, and literary characters). We will also spend some time investigating how ‘literature’ and ‘philosophy’ evolved as separate yet related disciplines.","title":"Literature and Philosophy","department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,1.5,5.5],"prerequisite":"i) EN1101E or GEK1000, AND (ii) at least one of the following modules (EN2201, EN2202, EN2203, EN2204, EN2205, EN2207)","corequisite":"So long as students have fulfilled EN1101E/GEK1000, they may take this EN level-3000 module in the same semester as they are taking one of the following modules (EN2201, EN2202, EN2203, EN2204, EN2205, EN2207).","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"EN3251","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":{"and":[{"or":["EN1101E","GEK1000"]},{"or":["EN2201","EN2202","EN2203","EN2204","EN2205","EN2207"]}]}}
