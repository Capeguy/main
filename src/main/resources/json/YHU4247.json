{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"Why do we preserve and construct the past? And how do we do it? Museums and libraries are the institutional brains of cultureâthey collect, store, and display the knowledge and artefacts of worldâthe sum of the human intellect and imagination. We will examine the histories and sometimes destruction of these two cultural institutions. Our approach will be both historical and theoretical in considering constructions of the universal/global and local/particular, things and ideas, the continuous dialogue between past and present and future. Course includes fieldtrips to the National Library of Singapore and the National Gallery of Singapore.","title":"Museums and Libraries as Cultural Institutions","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,0,9.5],"prerequisite":"YCC1111 Literature and Humanities 1 and\nYCC1112 Literature and Humanities 2 and\nat least one 3000 level module in history or literature or\nwith the permission of instructor.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YHU4247","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1430","endTime":"1730","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-CR18","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18}]}],"prereqTree":{"and":["YCC1111","YCC1112"]}}
