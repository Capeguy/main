{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"Animals rely on various sensory systems to detect environmental information; a common mode involves light detection. Many rely on visual stimuli for numerous behavioural activities; humans often fail to understand these light signals. This module will introduce: (i) the fundamentals of light detection, (ii) the instrumentation and software involved in accurate detection, quantification/characterisation of animal/plant light signals, (iii) the formulation of hypotheses in animal-animal and animal-plant visual communication from interdisciplinary sciences (e.g. behaviour, conservation, optics), and (iv) relevant industrial applications. This module will also visit some other systems beyond the visible light spectrum, for example: infrared reception and thermoreception.","title":"Light & Vision in Animal Communication","department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","workload":[2,1,1,2,4],"prerequisite":"LSM3267 Behavioural Biology","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"LSM4267","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S1A-03LAB2","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50}],"examDate":"2019-11-26T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"prereqTree":"LSM3267"}
