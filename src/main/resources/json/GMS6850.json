{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This one-semester module covers core concepts in bioinformatics with an emphasis on working with omics-scale data. Covered topics: biological sequence analysis include alignments, searching, and annotation; analysis of next-generation DNA and RNA sequencing data in multiple applications, including de-novo sequencing, re-sequencing for germ-line and cancer genetics, RNA-sequencing for multiple applications and ChIP-seq; microarray based SNP, gene-expression, and DNA-methylation analysis; metabolomics; proteomics; gene-set enrichment analysis; pathway analysis; analysis of protein-protein interaction networks; integrated analysis of multiple kinds of ‘omic’ data; availability and use of public data for all of the above The module will also provide a brief introduction to methods of computational modeling for biological networks.","title":"Core Concepts in Bioinformatics","department":"Duke-NUS Dean's Office","faculty":"Duke-NUS Medical School","workload":[6,0,0,0,4],"prerequisite":"GMS6901, “Molecules to Medicines”, or a strong undergraduate background in biology and molecular biology.
