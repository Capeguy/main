{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module will explore the Philippines’ almost 500 years of social and cultural history—from its early association with India, China and Southeast Asia, to its incorporation into the Spanish and American empires, to its tumultuous road towards independence and democratization. Students will consider Filipino religiosity and worldview, and analyze their ramifications in society. Popular images of the Philippines – homeland of international labor and site of natural hazards and spectacle of poverty – will be investigated. Students will take Philippine history as an exemplar towards a better understanding of the postcolonial condition that numerous nations experience.","title":"The Philippines: A Social and Cultural History","department":"History","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,2,5],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"HY3257","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"E1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS1-0209","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS4-0116","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":35},{"classNo":"E2","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS7-0102","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20}],"examDate":"2019-11-25T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}]}
