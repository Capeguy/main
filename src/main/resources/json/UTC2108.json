We examine the role and nature of\nknowledge, communication, data, trust, privacy, and related concepts from an interdisciplinary angle. Through 13 seminars, we explore these issues with examples such as big data, humanmachine interaction, engineering, and the internet. The goal of the module is to enable students to critically appreciate various forms of knowledge and assess how they shape our individual and collective lives.","title":"Senior Seminar: Technology and the Fate of Knowledge","department":"Tembusu College","faculty":"Residential College","workload":[0,3,0,3,4],"prerequisite":"GEM1902% or GEM1912% or UTC11%","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"UTC2108","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1900","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"TC-SR5","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":16}]}],"prereqTree":{"or":["GEM1902","GEM1912"]}}
