{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"GES1006","description":"The module aims to examine the evolving economic linkages between Singapore and India in a post Cold War setting and attempts to explain the factors that have led to their enhanced economic collaboration based on areas of complementarity.  The module will use concepts like economic regionalism, Singapore's regionalization policy and India's \"Look East\" policies to explain the confluence of national interests that has enhanced bilateral economic ties between both countries. In particular it will examine bilateral collaboration in infrastructure development (ports and telecommunications) and services (airline and tourism) industries to explain the success and problems of bilateral economic collaboration. The target audiences are students from various Faculties who would like to have a better understanding of Singapore's evolving foreign economic policy in South Asia in an increasingly globalised economy.","title":"Singapore and India: Emerging Relations","department":"South Asian Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,2,5],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"SSA2214","attributes":{"su":true},"aliases":["GES1006"],"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"UTSRC-LT52","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":5},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS1-0208","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":1},{"classNo":"D2","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"AS1-0201","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":1},{"classNo":"D1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"AS4-0601","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":1},{"classNo":"D3","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"AS3-0212","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":1},{"classNo":"E2","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS1-0201","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":1}]}]}
