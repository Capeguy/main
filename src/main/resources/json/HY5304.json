{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"Imperialism and Empires are two historical developments that no scholars of modern world, political, international, cultural, social, economic and  military history ever ignore. Imperialism remains  one of the most hotly debated historical forces in the discipline and has been approached by nearly every different methodology and perspective that academic historians have explored in the last century. This module will introduce graduate students to the approaches to a field that crosses all boundaries in the study of history. An important component will be the bibliography project, training students to develop their own grasp of the literature they must master.","title":"Imperialism & Empires: Historical Approaches","department":"History","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,0,7],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"HY5304","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS1-0524","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":12}]}]}
