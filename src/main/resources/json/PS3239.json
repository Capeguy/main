{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"The module aims to provide a broad understanding of international conflict situations, conflict behaviour and attitudes. It deals with the nature, type and sources of conflict. Based on insights from general conflict studies it explains conflict pathologies and the debilitating effects of protracted social conflicts. It also analyses various conflict resolution strategies by focusing on negotiation techniques, third party mediation and intervention. Bearing in mind that conflicts are mostly transformed rather than eliminated the module assesses the experience of peace-promotion and peace-building in post-conflict societies. The module is meant for students keen on a multi-disciplinary approach to international conflict.","title":"International Conflict Analysis","department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,2,5],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PS3239","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":75},{"classNo":"D2","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[1,3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"AS8-0402","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[2,4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS4-0604","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"D1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"AS8-0402","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25}]}]}
