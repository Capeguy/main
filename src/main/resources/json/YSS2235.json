{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"In this course we will examine how law is produced, mobilized and deployed by professionals and ordinary citizens. Attention will be given to the situational and systemic constraints within which actors in the legal system perform their roles We will also focus on the systematic patterns in the uses and consequences of law (Why do âthe havesâ come out ahead? What are the limits of law to bring about social change?)
