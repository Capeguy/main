{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"Although animals sense their physical and biotic\nenvironments via various modalities, how they sense the\nenvironment acoustically is still poorly understood. From\nlow frequency minute vibrations to infrasonic and ultrasonic\nfrequencies, from waterborne to air-transmitted sounds,\nthis module will introduce what sound is (i.e. fundamentals\nof sound, how sound travels etc), how and why it matters to\nanimals (i.e. mechanisms and adaptive functions of sound\nproduction and reception) in both terrestrial and marine\nhabitats, bioacoustic instrumentation and software,\nindustrial applications, and how environmental issues\ninvolving sounds such as terrestrial and ocean noise\npollution are affecting animals and humans.","title":"Environmental Bioacoustics","department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","workload":[2,0,2,2,4],"prerequisite":"LSM3267\nLSM3272","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"LSM4268","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S2-03LAB7","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50}],"examDate":"2019-12-05T09:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"prereqTree":{"or":["LSM3267","LSM3272"]}}
