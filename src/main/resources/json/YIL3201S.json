This course will also discuss a number of advanced and rare grammatical forms in Sanskrit.","title":"Directed Language Study: Advanced Sanskrit: The Mahabharata","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,4,0,2,6.5],"prerequisite":"YIL2201S Directed Language Study: Intermediate Sanskrit or equivalent","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YIL3201S","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":"YIL2201S"}
