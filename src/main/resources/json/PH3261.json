{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"Kant is widely regarded as one of the greatest philosophers, if not the greatest, and his Critique of Pure Reason is widely considered his greatest work. This course will delve into this work, entering into the intricate framework of Kant’s Transcendental Idealism. Major topics include Space and Time, the Categories, the Analogies (focusing on causation) and the Antinomies (focusing on the issue of freedom). Although the course focuses primarily on Kant’s metaphysics and epistemology, this grounding is expected to improve one’s understanding of the basis of Kant’s ethics, particularly when dealing with the Transcendental Dialectic.","title":"Kant's Critique of Pure Reason","department":"Philosophy","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,0,7],"prerequisite":"Must have completed a minimum of 4 MC in PH.","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PH3261","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS2-0413","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"W2","startTime":"1500","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS3-0306","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"W1","startTime":"0800","endTime":"0900","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS5-0309","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20}]}]}
