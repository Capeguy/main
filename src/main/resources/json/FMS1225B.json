When the pathogen (e.g. bacteria or virus) interacts with the host (human or animal), it will divert the function of the host cells for the survival and benefit of the pathogen; causes infection and becomes disease. The major aim of this module is to briefly discuss the causes, prevention, remedies, and economic implications of the common infectious diseases as well as the regional infectious diseases such as Dengue and SARS.","title":"Infectious Diseases and Host-Pathogen Interactions","department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","workload":[0,2,0,4,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"FMS1225B","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"L1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S2-0415","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":15}]},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"L1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S2-0415","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":15}]}]}
