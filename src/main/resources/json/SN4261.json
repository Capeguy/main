{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"Cultural contacts between South Asia and Southeast Asia started around the 3rd c AD.  Especially several South-Indian dynasties (as, e.g. the Pallavas and the Cholas), under which trade and the setting up of diplomatic ties flourished, were the main responsible forces for an early spread of Indian cultural and social concepts and values beyond South Asia – and especially to Southeast Asia.  The module aims at looking at those early forms of contact between the two regions, and at providing an understanding of the concepts of “kingship”, society, religion and culture, that became shared as a consequence.  We will explore how much about “everyday life” in old times can be learned from inscriptions, and how temple-constructions and other pieces of Art can give insights into these concepts.  We will also look into early trade-connections between South India and Southeast Asia (trading guilds) and into the impact of cultural influence – especially of the Chola dynasty – in the region.","title":"South and Southeast Asia: Early Contacts","department":"South Asian Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,3,9],"prerequisite":"Cohort 2011 and before:\nCompleted 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in SN, or 28 MCs in SC with a minimum CAP of 3.50 or be on the Honours track.\n\nCohort 2012 onwards:\nCompleted 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in SN or 28 MCs in SC or 28 MCs in GL/GL recognised non-language modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"SN4261","semesterData":[]}
