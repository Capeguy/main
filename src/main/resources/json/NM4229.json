{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"The module focuses on the blurring of boundaries between forms, modes, and methods of communication through the emergence of new media. Drawing on the cultural heritage of selected Asian societies, through art, architecture and oral narratives, students will reâinterpret these cultural text and meanings to exhibit them in new media forms. In this sense then, new media not only offer opportunities for convergence and integration across various forms of expression, but they also fundamentally reshape our understanding of communication. Students will showcase traditional cultural communication through digital archives, a cloud museum, blogs and design online experiential books, digital performance, and digital art.","title":"Cultural Communication and Creative Expression","department":"Communications and New Media","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,5,4.5],"prerequisite":"Cohort 2011 and before:\nCompleted 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in NM, with a minimum CAP of 3.50 or be on the Honours track.\n\nCohort 2012 onwards:\nCompleted 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in NM or 28 MCs in GL/GL recognised nonâlanguage modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"NM4229","semesterData":[]}
