It  incorporates basic concepts, data sources and tools used in demography into a systems approach to modelling population dynamics.\n\nStudents will build models of increasing complexity, covering a variety of generic structures and classic system dynamics modelling scenarios.","title":"Thinking in Systems: Population Dynamics","department":"Residential College 4","faculty":"Residential College","workload":[0,2,0,4,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"UTC1702D","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1500","endTime":"1700","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"RC4-SR3","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"RC4-SR3","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18}]},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"RC4-SR3","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":16}]}]}
