{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module is concerned with an area in Moral Philosophy called 'meta-ethics'. Meta-ethics is a discussion of the nature of ethics. It is a second-order, reflective activity about ethics, and not a first-order discussion of the rights and wrongs of particular issues within ethics. Beginning with non-naturalism, the module proceeds to discuss emotivism, prescriptivism, descriptivism or naturalism, culminating in current discussion of moral realism.","title":"Moral Philosophy","department":"Philosophy","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,0,7],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PH3203","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS4-0109","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":60},{"classNo":"D1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"AS3-0302","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"D3","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"AS3-0215","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"D2","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"AS3-0302","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20}]}]}
