{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module covers the fundamental principles of modern electrical energy systems including three-phase analysis. Upon completion of this course, students will be able to analyse, model, and predict the performance of energy systems and devices like generators, transformers, transmission lines and various types of loads and power electronic converters. The module is designed specifically to help students develop a broad systems perspective and an understanding of the principal elements of electrical energy systems. Furthermore, lecture materials are relevant to PE exams. Students will be prepared to work effectively with electrical engineers on the joint solution of complex problems.","title":"Electrical Energy Systems","department":"SCALE Dean's Office","faculty":"Cont and Lifelong Education","workload":[3,1,1,0,5],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"TEE3506","semesterData":[{"semester":3,"timetable":[{"classNo":"2","startTime":"2030","endTime":"2130","weeks":{"start":"2020-05-11","end":"2020-06-22","weekInterval":2},"venue":"E1-06-03","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2030","weeks":{"start":"2020-05-13","end":"2020-07-08"},"venue":"E1-06-01","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":60},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2030","weeks":{"start":"2020-05-11","end":"2020-06-22","weekInterval":2},"venue":"E1-06-01","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":60},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"2030","endTime":"2130","weeks":{"start":"2020-05-13","end":"2020-07-08"},"venue":"E1-06-01","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"2030","endTime":"2130","weeks":{"start":"2020-05-13","end":"2020-07-08"},"venue":"E1-06-03","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"2030","endTime":"2130","weeks":{"start":"2020-05-11","end":"2020-06-22","weekInterval":2},"venue":"E1-06-01","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30}]}]}
