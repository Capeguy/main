{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module is designed for graduate students in mathematics, who have sufficient background in mathematical logic. The course will be structured around Morleyâs Categoricity Theorem.  To set up the stage of the proof of Morleyâs Theorem, some necessary knowledge is also introduced, which turns out to be a good training in model theory.","title":"Model Theory","department":"Mathematics","faculty":"Science","workload":[3,0,0,2,5],"prerequisite":"MA5219 or departmental approval","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"MA6220","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":"MA5219"}
