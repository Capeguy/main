{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"Students majoring in Physics. Students must not have passed PC1431 or PC1431FC.","description":"The module is designed to provide a clear and logical introduction to the concepts and principles of mechanics and thermodynamics, with illustrations based on applications to the real world. Topics covered include motion in one dimension; curvilinear motion; circular motion; relative motion; Newton's laws; friction; work and energy; conservative forces, conservation of energy; linear momentum and conservation, collisions; rotational kinematics; moment of inertia and torque; rotational dynamics; conservation of angular momentum; temperature and the zeroth law, temperature scales; heat and internal energy, specific heat capacities, work for ideal gases, first law of thermodynamics; equipartition of energy, entropy and the second law, heat engines; entropy changes for reversible and irreversible processes. The module is targeted essentially at Engineering students.","title":"Physics IE","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","workload":[2,0.5,0.5,1,3],"prerequisite":"Students from FOE (i.e. Civil Eng, Environmental Eng,  Common Engineering, Mechanical Eng, Bioengineering, Industrial & Systems Eng and Material Science & Eng) with âAâ level or H2 pass in Physics; or 'A' level or H2 pass in Physics","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PC1431X","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[],"fulfillRequirements":["PC2230","PC2193","PC2132","TME2121","ME2143E","ME2121E","TME2143"]}
