{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This seminar examines the phenomenon of war during the years between the emergence of the modern nation-state and the end of the Cold War. We survey the leading theories on the causes of war, their key concepts and causal variables, the causal paths leading to war or to peace, and the conditions under which various outcomes are most likely to occur. We also closely examine key historical works on major wars, and evaluate the degree of empirical support for various theories and hypotheses. The module will also explore sources of great power conflict in todayâs international politics.","title":"Study of Modern Wars","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,3,6.5],"prerequisite":"YSS2221 International Security OR\nYSS2202 International Relations OR with the permission of the instructor.","corequisite":"YSS2221 International Security OR YSS2202 International Relations","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSS4243","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":{"or":["YSS2221","YSS2202"]}}
