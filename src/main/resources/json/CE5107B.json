{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This is an advanced module in deep foundation engineering. Topics covered include piles subject to ground movement, piles in difficult ground, foundations for marine structures, construction related problems, pile driving analysis and dynamic testing, and static pile tests, as well as design via Eurocode 7.\n\nParticipants will learn how to deal with design and construction issues pertaining to deep foundations under more general and realistic practical situations. \n\nSpecific learning objectives include performing design calculations for piles and pile groups under more complex loading modes and ground conditions and pile installation and testing.","title":"Pile Foundation Problems and EC7 Impact","department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[1,0,0,0.5,3.5],"prerequisite":"Background in soil mechanics and foundation engineering or equivalent.\nCE5107A Principles of Pile Foundation Design","moduleCredit":"2","moduleCode":"CE5107B","attributes":{"lab":true,"ssgf":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1700","weeks":[12,13],"venue":"EA-02-11","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":80},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2100","weeks":{"start":"2019-12-05","end":"2019-12-05"},"venue":"LT6","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":80},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2100","weeks":{"start":"2019-11-21","end":"2019-11-28"},"venue":"EA-02-11","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":80}]}]}
