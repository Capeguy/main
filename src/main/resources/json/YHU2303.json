{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"A philosophical examination of the horror genre. How can audiences be scared of monsters they know to be fictional? How can we take positive pleasure in emotions like dread, fear, and disgust, which we usually avoid in ordinary life? Is horror an immoral genre that cultivates vices in its audiences? Or can horror fictions be ethically salutary and provide a space for philosophical clarification? We will read and analyze classical and contemporary works in philosophy and film theory. We will also explore and discuss classic and contemporary horror films, short stories, and novels from around the world.","title":"The Aesthetics of Fear: Horror & the Philosophy of Art","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,2,7.5],"moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YHU2303","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1730","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-CR14","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1730","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-CR14","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18}]}]}
