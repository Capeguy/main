{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"- Application Development Project\nThis is a pre-internship project where the students will work in a team to apply the project management, analysis, design, business communications and programming skills learnt earlier in the course. Based on a User Requirement Statement given to the students, they will go through a complete software development life cycle to develop and deliver the required system. The students will capture requirements through user interviews, produce a feasible design of the system, code, test and implement the solution in a distributed platform. This project provides a simulation of the real-life IT working environment, and tests their strengths in working closely as a project team.","title":"AD Project","department":"Institute of Systems Science","faculty":"Institute of Systems Science","workload":[0,0,0,15,0],"moduleCredit":"6","moduleCode":"SA4106","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1700","weeks":{"start":"2019-07-08","end":"2019-08-05"},"venue":"Interaction","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1700","weeks":{"start":"2019-07-11","end":"2019-08-01"},"venue":"Interaction","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1700","weeks":{"start":"2019-07-12","end":"2019-08-02"},"venue":"Interaction","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1700","weeks":{"start":"2019-07-09","end":"2019-08-06"},"venue":"Interaction","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1700","weeks":{"start":"2019-07-10","end":"2019-07-31"},"venue":"Interaction","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150}]},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1700","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5],"venue":"Interaction","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1700","weeks":[1,3,4,5],"venue":"Interaction","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1700","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5],"venue":"Interaction","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1700","weeks":[1,2,4,5],"venue":"Interaction","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1700","weeks":[1,2,4,5],"venue":"Interaction","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150}]}]}
