{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"What does good reasoning look like? What does it aim for? How should\nwe argue with our opponents? Nyāya, a tradition within Brahminical\nIndian philosophy presented and defended sophisticated methods of\nreasoning and norms for debate that are still being studied today. In this\ncourse, we focus on sections of the Nyāya-sūtra in translation and its\nearly commentaries, along with some Buddhist and Mīmāṃsā texts. Not\nonly will we consider methods and norms, but we will look at how\nIndian thinkers put them into practice in arguments on topics such as\nthe existence of God.","title":"Debate and Reasoning in Indian Philosophy","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,0,9.5],"prerequisite":"Recommend one philosophy course other than Philosophy and Political\nThought","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YHU3297","semesterData":[]}
