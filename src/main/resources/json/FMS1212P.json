The aim of the module is to show, in a playful way, that this is not (always) the case, that really simple systems ranging from physics, meteorology, engineering, computer science, biology and economics, can have a rich, complex âŚ and unpredictable behavior. Many notions are at the heart of this module such as determinism versus predictability, chaos, the need for a statistical description, random walks, ergodicity, entropy, fractals, cellular automata, self-organized criticality, emergent behavior, etc.","title":"SYC: Simple Yet Complex","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","workload":[0,2,0,4,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"FMS1212P","semesterData":[]}
