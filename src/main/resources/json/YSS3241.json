It aims to introduce the Chinese traditional political thoughts that date back to the period before Qin Dynasty, i.e. up to 221 B.C. In particular, it aims to demonstrate what and how the major ancient Chinese political thinkers understand and discuss the important philosophical questions in the field of politics that are (more than often) still relevant nowadays. To this end, this course takes a thematic rather than a chronological approach.","title":"Chinese Political Philosophy: Confucianism & its Rivals","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,3.5,6],"prerequisite":"YCC1113 Philosophy and Political Thought 1 AND YCC1114 Philosophy and\nPolitical Thought 2 OR with the permission of course convenor.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSS3241","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1430","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-CR5","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1430","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-CR5","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18}]}],"prereqTree":{"and":["YCC1113","YCC1114"]}}
