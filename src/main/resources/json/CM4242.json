{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"Advanced mass spectrometric methods, and scanning probe microscopies form an important group of advanced analytical techniques widely used for research & development, and also for process/product control in advanced manufacturing industries. Microfluidics & labchip techniques, in particular, are increasingly used for biochemical assays in biomedical devices. Students will learn the principles, instrumentation and applications of these techniques, and receive in-depth training in selected advanced analytical techniques, including advanced mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).","title":"Advanced Analytical Techniques","department":"Chemistry","faculty":"Science","workload":[3,1,0,3,3],"prerequisite":"CM3242 or by Departmental approval","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"CM4242","attributes":{"ssgf":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S8-0314","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":80},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S8-0314","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":80},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1700","weeks":[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S8-0314","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":100}],"examDate":"2019-11-29T06:30:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"prereqTree":"CM3242","fulfillRequirements":["CM5241"]}
