{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"The study of language typology and universals is concerned with the evaluation of how the various linguistic subsystems in any language differ from those\nfound in most other languages, and whether linguistic diversity is a norm or otherwise. In this introduction to typology, students will acquire a fundamental overview of the grammatical make-up of languages, and an appreciation for an important approach in contemporary linguistics. Language typology contributes to and draws on core areas of linguistics such as phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, and language\nacquisition, among others.","title":"Language Typology","department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,3,4],"prerequisite":"EL2101 or EL2201","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"EL3213","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":{"or":["EL2101","EL2201"]}}
