{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module concerns the application of experimental psychology research to the improvement of human-machine/environment interactions. This is not designed as a \"cookbook\" module where the principles of good human factors are merely enumerated. Rather, the emphasis will be placed on the theoretical principles underlying information processing and human performance. The topics include: signal detection and information theory; attention; spatial displays; navigation; memory and training; selection of action, manual control; time-sharing and workload; and the effects of stress on human error.","title":"Human Performance","department":"Psychology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,3,4],"prerequisite":"PL1101E and PL3233","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PL3250","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"D1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"AS3-0306","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":22},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS3-0214","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":20},{"classNo":"D4","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"AS4-B107","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":22}]}],"prereqTree":{"and":["PL1101E","PL3233"]}}
