{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"Preparation and characterization of materials form crucial  and vital aspects of materials research. Highly developed instruments are now available to apply an interdisciplinary study to understand the structure-property relationship. This module provides undergraduates an introduction to modern materials characterization techniques which comprise surface analysis techniques, X-ray diffraction,  microscopy, thermal analyses, mechanical tastings and spectroscopies.","title":"Characterization Techniques in Materials Chemistry","department":"Chemistry","faculty":"Science","workload":[4,1,0,1,4],"prerequisite":"CM3252 or CM3253","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"CM4251","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S1A-0217","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":80},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S1A-0217","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":80},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0800","endTime":"0900","weeks":[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S5-0224","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":80}],"examDate":"2019-12-05T09:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"prereqTree":{"or":["CM3252","CM3253"]}}
