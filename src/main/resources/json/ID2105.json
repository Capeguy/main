{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"As a progression from the design fundamentals, this module aggregates all the prior lessons into one complete, coherent, industrially-relevant project where students learn to manage, and go through the whole process of 1) initial design research and market research, to 2) formulating the design strategy and 3) design brief, through to 4) conceptualization, 5) evaluation phases, and 6) detailing and refinement.\nThe design is aimed for a specific context which includes specific users, market scenarios, environments, trends, business / competition, and feasibility / manufacturing factors. Critical consideration for sustainability factors is incorporated as part of the context criteria.","title":"Design for Context and Sustainability","department":"Industrial Design","faculty":"Design and Environment","workload":[2,6,0,12,0],"prerequisite":"Pass ID 1105 & 1106","moduleCredit":"8","moduleCode":"ID2105","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Design Lecture","size":60},{"classNo":"B5","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial Type 2","size":25},{"classNo":"B2","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"UTSRC-SR5","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial Type 2","size":25},{"classNo":"A5","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"A6","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"A1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"A4","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"B3","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial Type 2","size":25},{"classNo":"B7","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial Type 2","size":25},{"classNo":"B1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial Type 2","size":25},{"classNo":"A7","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"A8","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"A9","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"B10","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial Type 2","size":25},{"classNo":"B9","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial Type 2","size":25},{"classNo":"A10","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"B4","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial Type 2","size":25},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Design Lecture","size":60},{"classNo":"A3","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"B6","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial Type 2","size":25},{"classNo":"A2","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"UTSRC-SR9","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"B8","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial Type 2","size":25}]}]}
