{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"PF2104,PF2503","description":"This module covers the mechanical and electrical systems in modern facilities, with special focus on a building. It considers the design principles, operation and maintenance of major systems such as:\nheating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, power generation and distribution, vertical and horizontal transportation systems, fire fighting systems, communication and security systems, as well as piping and plumbing systems. This module also covers the engineering principles and key factors influencing the thermal environments and quantification of these factors, functional requirements of\nutilities, and the design of systems to local codes.","title":"M&E Systems","department":"Building","faculty":"Design and Environment","workload":[2,2,0,2,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PF2505","attributes":{"su":true,"ssgf":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"GBT-Lab","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"GBT-Lab","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"UTSRC-LT52","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":120},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"GBT-Lab","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"4","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"GBT-Lab","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30}],"examDate":"2020-05-04T05:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}]}
