Given the scope of the module and its educational outcomes, the module draws students from diverse disciplines within NUS including \"Law\", \"Business\" and \"Computing\", etc. The key strength of the module is its diversity in terms of disciplinary composition. To take advantage of this diversity, the module promotes \"collaborative learning\" through peer teaching & learning by dividing the large class into multi-disciplinary teams of 5 students. The instructor assigns reading materials to individual teams on broad topics that cut across human society and culture.","title":"Global Environmental Issues","department":"SCALE Dean's Office","faculty":"Cont and Lifelong Education","workload":[2,1,0,1,2],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"GEH1025T","attributes":{"su":true},"aliases":["GEK1522T"],"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"2030","endTime":"2130","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"UT-AUD1","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":150},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2030","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"UT-AUD1","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150}],"examDate":"2020-04-28T09:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120},{"semester":3,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2030","weeks":{"start":"2020-05-13","end":"2020-07-08"},"venue":"ENG-AUD","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":220},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2030","weeks":{"start":"2020-05-11","end":"2020-06-22","weekInterval":2},"venue":"ENG-AUD","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":220},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"2030","endTime":"2130","weeks":{"start":"2020-05-13","end":"2020-07-08"},"venue":"ENG-AUD","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":220},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"2030","endTime":"2130","weeks":{"start":"2020-05-11","end":"2020-06-22","weekInterval":2},"venue":"ENG-AUD","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":220}],"examDate":"2020-07-11T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}]}
