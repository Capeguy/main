{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This  module  introduces  students  to  the  fundamental  electronic principles of sensor systems for a variety of different disciplines. Particular  emphasis  will  be  given  to  circuits  that  are  used  in research and development, such as sensor amplifiers, filters, and data-acquisition.  The  module  has  both  analogue  and  digital circuit  principles,  and  involves  project  activities  that  involve hands-on  construction  of  sensors,  their  circuits  and  translating their signals into digital data on to a computer.","title":"Sensor System Electronics","department":"Engineering Science Programme","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[6,2,3,0,4],"prerequisite":"A-level Mathematics and Physics","moduleCredit":"6","moduleCode":"ESP1104A","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
