{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"From the betel popular across the region for millenia, to colonial opium regimes, to Bangkokâs Soi Cowboy, vice has always been a part of life in Southeast Asia. In this module, students investigate the economic, political, social, ecological, and cultural significance of a variety of substances and activities, from drugs like opium, alcohol and caffeine, to activities like paid sex and gambling. Students use a range of texts, including scholarly articles, memoirs, movies, and firstâhand observation to investigate the ways illicit substances and behaviors are deeply imbricated in everyday life in Southeast Asia.","title":"Forbidden Pleasures: Vice in Southeast Asia","department":"Southeast Asian Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,3,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"SE2225","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"E1","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS3-0307","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"E3","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS1-0207","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"E2","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS1-0207","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":60}]}]}
