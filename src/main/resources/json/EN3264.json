{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This course provides an intensive introduction to key topics in post‐colonial theory through an overview of representative literary and theoretical texts. The syllabus demonstrates the vexed significance of the “post” in post‐colonial cultural traditions. In tracing how decolonization remains bound up with older, colonial forms of knowledge/power, we approach post‐coloniality as an aftermath. Through a range of writerly forms and cultural media, we identify the post‐colonial in the question of “tradition” and its centrality to “non‐Western” modernity; in inscriptions of race/ethnicity/sexuality into Third World humanism; as the mourning for a vanishing past; as aesthetic resistance to homogenizing processes of modernization.","title":"In Other Wor(l)ds: Post ‐colonial Theory & Literature","department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,0,7],"prerequisite":"(i) EN1101E or GEK1000, AND (ii) at least one of the following modules (EN2201, EN2202, EN2203, EN2204, EN2205, EN2207)","corequisite":"So long as students have fulfilled EN1101E/GEK1000, they may take this EN level-3000 module in the same semester as they are taking one of the following modules (EN2201, EN2202, EN2203, EN2204, EN2205, EN2207).","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"EN3264","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":{"and":[{"or":["EN1101E","GEK1000"]},{"or":["EN2201","EN2202","EN2203","EN2204","EN2205","EN2207"]}]}}
