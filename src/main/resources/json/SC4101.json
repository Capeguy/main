{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module aims to provide honours students with a final opportunity to recollect, summarize and reorganise the disparate modules in their four years of studying anthropology and sociology. The broad philosophical and pragmatic questions addressed in this course are: What is meant by thinking anthropologically and sociologically? How does one put anthropologically nuanced and sociologically framed analysis and subsequently knowledge derived to work at different scales in institutional activities. How does one practise anthropology and sociology in everyday life? In short, what does it meant to be an anthropologist or a sociologist?","title":"Practising Anthropology and Sociology","department":"Sociology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,5,4.5],"prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in SC with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"SC4101","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"E2","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS2-0413","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"D2","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"AS1-0208","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"D4","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"AS1-0301","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT10","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":140},{"classNo":"D1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"AS4-0604","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS1-0208","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"E3","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS4-0109","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"D3","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"AS4-0118","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20}]}]}
