{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"The ocean covers 70% of the Earth’s surface and, through its interaction\nwith the atmosphere, plays a key role in Earth’s climate. This course\nexplores how marine ecosystems respond to, and play a role in, climate\nvariability. We will examine factors regulating oceanic productivity,\nincluding how large-scale, coupled oceanographic/atmospheric\nprocesses, such as El Niño and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, affect food\nwebs from plankton to commercially-harvested fish. This course will also\nlook at the influence of anthropogenic climate change on the stability\nand productivity of marine ecosystems.","title":"Effects of Climate on Marine Ecosystems","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,12,0,0,24],"moduleCredit":"1","moduleCode":"YSH2428","semesterData":[]}
