{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"Everyone hears advice that the unexamined life is not worth living.  Yet how often do we examine lives across print, visuals, sound, and more?  How often, moreover, do we consider lives that are not human?  Students in this integrative module explore lives human and non-human, including their own, marshalling varied media and analytical modes.\nThe first lives that we examine are in the form of science writing about non-human lives.  Next, we move to human lives, real and imagined.  This module puts local (and âglocalâ) spin on expressive and critical narration to strengthen critical and communication skills.","title":"Examining Local Lives","department":"University Scholars Programme","faculty":"University Scholars Programme","workload":[0,4,0,3,3],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"USE2321","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
