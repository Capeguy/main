Each team will work with a selected technology developed at NUS that has a promise to generate a large market impact. The students will learn how to actually start a high-tech company based on a particular technology. This course is NOT about how to write a business plan or create a presentation for VCs. Itâs about taking action - talking to customers, partners, competitors in search for the right market and the right business model that can leverage the uniqueness of a technology. Itâs about\nexperiencing the typical creative start-up process that is often full of uncertainty to turn a new technology into a great company.","title":"LaunchPad: Experiential Entrepreneurship","department":"Industrial Systems Engineering and Management","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[6,0,0,7,7],"moduleCredit":"8","moduleCode":"MT5910","attributes":{"grsu":true},"semesterData":[]}
