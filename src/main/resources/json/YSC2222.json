{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"The structure, properties, and reactivity of carbon-based molecules will be directly observed and inferred in this laboratory-based course, which supplements YSC2224 Accelerated Organic Chemistry. Students will put their newly acquired theoretical knowledge in practice and thus gain a much deeper understanding of the material. Topics include reaction set-up and purification, IR, NMR, GC-MS and LC-MS analysis, as well as an advanced synthesis project.","title":"Organic Chemistry Laboratory","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,0,4,2,6.5],"prerequisite":"Students must have either taken YSC2224 Accelerated Organic Chemistry previously or enrol into YSC2224 Accelerated Organic Chemistry concurrently, or with the permission of the instructor.","corequisite":"YSC2224 Accelerated Organic Chemistry, if student has not previously taken it.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSC2222","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1230","endTime":"1630","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-ChemLab","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18}]}],"prereqTree":{"or":["YSC2224"]}}
