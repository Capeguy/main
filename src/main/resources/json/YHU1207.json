{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"In this course, students will write creative responses to visual art, and read examples of ekphrasis (as itâs known) by poets, fiction writers, and essayists. The class will take a field trip to the Singapore Art Museum to write flash fiction, lyric essays, and/or poems in response to a particular piece of art, and weâll be writing a number of creative works in response to photographs, sometimes familiar family photos and sometimes photos by wellknown photographers. The final project will pair students as both photographers and word artists, responding to the visual work of their classmates in a class exhibit.","title":"Ekphrasis: Creative Writing in Dialogue With Visual Art","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,7,0],"moduleCredit":"2","moduleCode":"YHU1207","semesterData":[]}
