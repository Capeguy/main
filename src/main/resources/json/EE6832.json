{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"The objective of this module is to provide students the theory and concept of multi-antenna communications. The fundamental theory of conventional antenna arrays is covered in the first part. In the second part, the latest developments and techniques in multi-antenna communications are described, such as smart antenna technology, MIMO communication technique, adaptive array beamforming, etc. The focus of this module will be on the antenna array as a realization method to enable multi-antenna communications. The array design techniques will be highlighted and emphasized. The effect of antenna and array configuration characteristics on multichannel simultaneous  communications and the dependence of the multi-channel ommunications on the antenna arrays will be fully illustrated and exemplified in this module.","title":"Advanced Multi-Antenna Communications","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[3,0,0,4,3],"prerequisite":"EE5308 or EE5308R","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"EE6832","attributes":{"grsu":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E3-06-10","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30}]}],"prereqTree":{"or":["EE5308","EE5308R"]}}
