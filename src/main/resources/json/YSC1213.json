{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This introductory physics course uses the platform of hands-on\nelectronics to introduce students to concepts in electro-magnetism\nincluding electrostatics and electrodynamics. Using electronic\ncomponents to build linear and non-linear oscillators, students will be\nintroduced to concepts in nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory. The\ncourse is intended for both science majors and also non-majors.","title":"General Physics","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,1.5,3,0,8],"prerequisite":"YSC1216 Calculus or equivalent strongly recommended.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSC1213","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1030","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-PgRm2","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-PgRm2","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18}],"examDate":"2019-11-25T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":180}],"prereqTree":"YSC1216","fulfillRequirements":["YSC2246","YSC3213","YSC2225","YSC2203","YSC3224","YSC3246","YSC2212"]}
