{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"EE5907","description":"The main objectives of this graduate module are to equip\nstudents with the fundamentals of statistical pattern\nrecognition (SPR) algorithms and techniques. PR deals\nwith automated classification, identification, and/or\ncharacterisations of signals/data from various sources.\nBecause real world data is noisy and uncertain, we will\nfocus on SPR techniques, with particular emphasis on the\ntheoretical foundations of various techniques. Topics\ncovered include: fundamentals of parameter estimation\n(maximum likelihood, maximum-a-posteriori, posterior\npredictive), supervised learning, generative models, naive\nBayes, discriminative models, logistic regression, nonparametric\ntechniques, Bayesian decision theory.","title":"Statistical Pattern Recognition","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[3,0,0,2,5],"prerequisite":"This course assumes students have taken an undergraduate probability/statistics course, an undergraduate programming course and have at least a basic linear algebra background, all of which should be covered in a typical electrical engineering or computer science undergraduate program.","moduleCredit":"2","moduleCode":"EE5027","attributes":{"lab":true,"ssgf":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6],"venue":"LT1","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":20},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1700","endTime":"2100","weeks":{"start":"2019-09-26","end":"2019-09-26"},"venue":"E3-06-12","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":20}]},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6],"venue":"LT1","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":20},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1700","endTime":"2100","weeks":{"start":"2020-02-25","end":"2020-02-25"},"venue":"E3-06-13","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":20}]}]}
