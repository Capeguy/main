Research is being carried out\nworldwide to find alternate sources of energy. Solar and\nwind energy sound most promising but their intermittent\nnature is a major drawback. To counter this, significant\nR&D is being done to devise efficient energy storage\ndevices. This module attempts to give an overview of\nalternate energy systems and highlight the importance of\nenergy storage devices. Principle of operation, R&D and\nfuture trends, merits and limitations of various energy\nstorage systems will be discussed. Pumped storage\ndevices, fuel cells, batteries and their types, super\ncapacitors and hydrogen storage will be focused upon.","title":"Energy Storage Devices - State of the Art","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","workload":[0,3,0,4,3],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"FMS1206P","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"L1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S16-0309","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":15}]}]}
