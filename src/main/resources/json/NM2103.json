It covers fundamental concepts in research design, instrumentation, data collection, and data analysis. This module also introduces basic concepts of statistics such as descriptive statistics, sampling distribution, hypothesis testing. A set of computer lab assignments will give students extensive opportunities to become familiar with the relevant computer software package and experience at computing the various statistics reviewed in the class.","title":"Quantitative Research Methods","department":"Communications and New Media","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,3,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"NM2103","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT14","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":120},{"classNo":"W5","startTime":"1700","endTime":"1800","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS6-0215B","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"W4","startTime":"0800","endTime":"0900","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS6-0215B","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"W2","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1700","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS6-0215B","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"W6","startTime":"1700","endTime":"1800","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS6-0215B","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"W3","startTime":"1800","endTime":"1900","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS6-0215B","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"W1","startTime":"1800","endTime":"1900","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS6-0215B","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20}],"examDate":"2019-11-30T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"W4","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS6-0215B","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"W6","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1700","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS6-0215B","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"W5","startTime":"1800","endTime":"1900","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS6-0215B","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"W2","startTime":"1700","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS6-0215B","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"W1","startTime":"1100","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS6-0215B","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":120},{"classNo":"W3","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS6-0215B","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20}]}]}
