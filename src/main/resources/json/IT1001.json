It is structured to be the course for students who either plans to take only one course in computing in her entire undergraduate studies or wants to equip herself to do further more specialised computing studies. The module tries to be broad by touching on most aspects of computing. However, there will also be some technical depth in standard introductory computing topics. The lectures will be intensely complemented by Web exploring activities.","title":"Introduction to Computing","department":"Information Systems and Analytics","faculty":"Computing","workload":[2,1,0,3,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"IT1001","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1100","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS6-0211","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS6-0211","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"COM1-0204","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":80}],"examDate":"2019-11-23T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"fulfillRequirements":["IT2001"]}
