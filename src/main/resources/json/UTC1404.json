{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"GEM1905","description":"According to cultural theorists like Stuart Hall, Michel Foucault and Antonio Gramsci, the structures that support dominant ideas in society could be political, economic, religious or cultural, among others. This module examines the power structures behind the dominant ideas of our time, asking why these structures have an interest in promoting or discrediting ideas about what is ‘good’ for our community and mankind. These ideas include human rights, citizenship, democracy, meritocracy, the ‘Washington Consensus,’ development, age of majority, and political correctness.","title":"Jr Sem: Power and Ideas","department":"College of Alice and Peter Tan","faculty":"Residential College","workload":[0,3,0,3,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"UTC1404","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1700","endTime":"2000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"CAPT-SR3","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":16}]}]}
