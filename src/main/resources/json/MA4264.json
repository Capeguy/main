{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"EC3312.","description":"Game theory provides a mathematical tool for multi-person decision making. The aim of this module is to provide an introduction to game theory, studying basic concepts, models and solutions of games and their applications.\n\n\n\nMajor topics: Games of normal form and extensive form; Applications in Economics; Relations between game theory and decision making. Games of complete information: Static games with finite or infinite strategy spaces, Nash equilibrium of pure and mixed strategy; Dynamic games, backward induction solutions, information sets, subgame-perfect equilibrium, finitely and infinitely repeated games. Games of incomplete information: Bayesian equilibrium; First price sealed auction, second price sealed auction, and other auctions; Dynamic Bayesian games; Perfect Bayesian equilibrium; Signaling games. Cooperative games: Bargaining theory; Cores of n-person cooperative games; The Shapley value and its applications in voting, cost sharing, etc.","title":"Game Theory","department":"Mathematics","faculty":"Science","workload":[3,1,0,0,6],"prerequisite":"(MA3236 or MA3252 or DSC3214 or DSN3701) and (MA2216 or ST2131 or ST2334)","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"MA4264","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1900","endTime":"2200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT21","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":130},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1900","endTime":"2000","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S17-0404","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1000","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S17-0404","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1100","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S17-0404","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30}],"examDate":"2020-05-06T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":150}],"prereqTree":{"and":[{"or":["MA3236","MA3252","DSC3214","DSN3701"]},{"or":["MA2216","ST2131","ST2334"]}]}}
