{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module covers the chemistry of d-block and f-block metals. An introduction to observed trend in physical and chemical properties of d-block transition metal complexes will be given. A comprehensive discussion on their electronic structures and spectra follows. Magnetic property, ligand substitution and redox reaction of these metal complexes will be illustrated. The f-block metals will be introduced leading to a discussion of the optical spectra of their complexes. Introduction to inorganic supramolecular chemistry, crystal engineering and solid state chemistry will be covered.","title":"Transition Metal Chemistry","department":"Chemistry","faculty":"Science","workload":[3,1,0,3,3],"prerequisite":"CM2111","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"CM3212","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1700","weeks":[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S16-0598","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":37},{"classNo":"4","startTime":"1700","endTime":"1800","weeks":[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S16-0598","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":38},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1000","weeks":[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S5-0224","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":37},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT31","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1400","weeks":[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S16-0430","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":38},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT31","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150}],"examDate":"2019-11-25T09:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"prereqTree":"CM2111","fulfillRequirements":["CM4211","CM4214","CM4215","CM4212"]}
