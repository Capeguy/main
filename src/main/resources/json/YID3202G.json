{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"The health of humans is inextricably related to the health of the planet.  The atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere and ecosphere are all being degraded to an extent by which their ability to provide the services that humanity relies upon are being compromised.  This course explores how the planetâs physical systems affect human health, and addresses solutions to reduce suffering.  Working with earth scientists, ecologists and public health specialists alongside organisations actively working toward solutions, this transdisciplinary approach seeks to understand the variables that inform policies and programmes aimed at reducing losses that accompany large-scale environmental change.","title":"Special Topics: Planetary Health","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,4,0,2.5,6],"moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YID3202G","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1030","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-CR7","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1030","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-CR7","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18}]}]}
