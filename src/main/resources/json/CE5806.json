{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module aims to equip students with the concepts, methodologies and tools to successfully control a project on site. In particular, they will learn to organise, plan and schedule a project for execution, and put in place controls for schedule and cost. They will learn advanced planning functions that include schedule compression, delay analysis and risk management. They will also learn to implement lean construction concepts which will dramatically improve performance by reducing waste, cost and increase value. Project plans can be made reliable with commitments from stakeholders. Students will learn to diagnose a construction process and devise strategies to increase productivity.","title":"Advanced Project Management with Lean Construction","department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[3,0,0,3,4],"prerequisite":"CE4 / EVE4- standing or higher; AND\nCE2183 Construction Project Management or Equivalent","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"CE5806","attributes":{"grsu":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT2","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":80}],"examDate":"2019-11-25T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"prereqTree":"CE2183"}
