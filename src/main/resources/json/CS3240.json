{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This course is intended for students in computing and related disciplines whose work focuses on human-computer interaction issues in the design of computer systems. The course stresses the importance of user-centred design and usability in the development of computer applications and systems. Students will be taken through the analysis, design, development, and evaluation of human-computer interaction methods for computer systems. They will acquire hands-on design skills through laboratory exercises and assignments. The course also covers HCI design principles and emphasizes the importance of contextual, organisational, and social factors in system design.","title":"Interaction Design","department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","workload":[2,1,1,3,3],"prerequisite":"CS1020/E or CS2020 or CS2030 or CS2113/T or NM3209 or NM2207/Y","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"CS3240","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS6-0421","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS6-0421","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"COM1-0210","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"COM1-0210","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1500","endTime":"1700","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"COM1-0210","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"4","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS6-0421","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1700","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"COM1-0210","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS6-0421","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20}],"examDate":"2019-11-26T09:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS6-0421","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS6-0421","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS6-0421","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"COM1-0210","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1500","endTime":"1700","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"COM1-0210","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"COM1-0210","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"4","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS6-0421","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1700","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"COM1-0210","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40}]}],"prereqTree":{"or":["CS1020","CS1020E","CS2020","CS2030","CS2113","CS2113T","NM3209","NM2207","NM2207Y"]},"fulfillRequirements":["CS5346","CS6206","CS4249","CS3283"]}
