{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module continues from PC2130 and completes the basic formation of the student in quantum mechanics. Description of composite systems: tensor product, two-particle entanglement; systems of N identical particles. Perturbation theory: time-independent, both non-degenerate and degenerate; example: Zeeman effect. Time-dependent: Fermi golden rule; example: atom in a classical e-m field. Discussion of stimulated and spontaneous emission.\nOther approximation schemes: the variational principle; the WKB approximation and the âclassicalâ region, tunneling and the connecting formula; the adiabatic approximation. Scattering: partial wave analysis and the Born approximation.","title":"Quantum Mechanics II","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","workload":[3,1,0,0,6],"prerequisite":"Students who have passed either PC2130 or PC2130B, and PC2134 or equivalent","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PC3130","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT29","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":120},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT29","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":120}],"examDate":"2019-11-27T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120},{"semester":4,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":{"start":"2020-06-22","end":"2020-07-27"},"venue":"S12-0403","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":20},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":{"start":"2020-06-24","end":"2020-07-29"},"venue":"S12-0403","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":20},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":{"start":"2020-06-22","end":"2020-07-27"},"venue":"S12-0403","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":20},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":{"start":"2020-06-24","end":"2020-07-29"},"venue":"S12-0403","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":20}],"examDate":"2020-07-30T05:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"prereqTree":{"and":[{"or":["PC2130","PC2130B"]},"PC2134"]},"fulfillRequirements":["PC5228","PC5210","PC5203","PC5201","PC4259","PC4246","PC4245","PC4230","PC4228","PC4130","PC3243","QT5101"]}
