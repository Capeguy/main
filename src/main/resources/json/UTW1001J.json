Students will consider the role that prizes play in shaping taste, how prizes evolve to respond to different cultural and historical contexts, and what they reflect about modern culture. Students will enter into a debate abut the meaning of prizes by analysing popular and scholarly texts, visiting websites and watching films. In this smallclass, interactive environment, the tutor will support students in honing reading and writing skills, while becoming sensitive to different rhetorical strategies.","title":"Prizes and Popular Culture","department":"Center for Engl Lang Comms","faculty":"NUS","workload":[0,4,0,0,6],"prerequisite":"Students must have passed/been exempted from the NUS Qualifying\nEnglish Test (QET) or have passed CELC English for Academic\nPurposes modules.","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"UTW1001J","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
