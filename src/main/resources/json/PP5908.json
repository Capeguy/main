{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"Financial marketsâ meltdown, climate change, and cyber-threats are only some of the global problems that states cannot  manage  alone.  All  require  cooperation among governments  and  increasingly  with  their  citizens  and  the private  sector;  some  need  international  norms  and mechanisms;  others  call  for  international  and  regional organizations. This course provides an introduction to the evolving architecture,  processes,  and  norms  of  global governance.  It  then  provides  an  in-depth  analysis  of  the actors,  norms,  and  challenges  in  the  supply  of  some of todayâs  critical  global  public  goods,  including  financial stability,  economic  development,  trade,  climate  change mitigation, global health, and a secure cyberspace.","title":"Global Governance in a Changing World","department":"LKYSPP Dean's Office","faculty":"LKY School of Public Policy","workload":[3,0,0,3,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PP5908","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LKY_TB10SR","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":90}]}]}
