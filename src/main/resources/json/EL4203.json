Emphasis will be placed on precise, formal descriptions of meanings as truth conditions and their computation. The contribution of the conversational context will also be discussed. Basic knowledge of English syntactic structure will be assumed.","title":"Semantics","department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,6,3.5],"prerequisite":"Cohort 2012-2014:\nCompleted 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in EL and EL3201,\nwith a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\nCohort 2015 onwards:\nCompleted 80 MCs, including (i) 28 MCs in EL or 28 MCs\nin PH, and (ii) EL3201, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be\non the honours track.
