{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module aims to study creativity in all the circumstances where art and poetry confront violence as a fact of life, whether in the form of violence to oneself or others, or to the environment or to institutions and values. The module draws examples from the history of art and poetry to address a single question: what can art and poetry do about the utter negativity that is violence? The module will aim to study the nature of violence on the scale of the individual and the group, and as having implications for gender, race, sexuality, politics, ideology, and ethics.","title":"Violence, Poetry and the Arts","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,4,5.5],"prerequisite":"Common Curriculum courses and at least one module at 2000 and one at 3000 should have been completed for either Arts and Humanities or Literature before enrolling for this module.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YHU4233","semesterData":[]}
