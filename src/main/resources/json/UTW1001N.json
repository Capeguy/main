In this course, students will explore and examine speakersâ public persona with a focus on interactional and social roles in performed presentations before a public audience. What does it mean to perform a public persona? How is public persona shaped, strengthened, or attenuated? Is there such a thing as an \"authentic\" public persona? In seminar-type classes and, subsequently, in writing assignments, students will analyse verbal and nonverbal performance of a speaker or speakers in mediated and/or non-mediated contexts, and develop informed views of their public persona.","title":"Public Persona and Self-presentations","department":"Center for Engl Lang Comms","faculty":"NUS","workload":[0,4,0,0,6],"prerequisite":"Students must have passed/been exempted from the NUS Qualifying\nEnglish Test (QET) or have passed CELC English for Academic\nPurposes modules.","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"UTW1001N","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"CAPT-SR6","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"RC4-SR5","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16},{"classNo":"4","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"TC-SR5","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16},{"classNo":"4","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"TC-SR5","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"CAPT-SR4","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"RC4-SR5","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"CAPT-SR4","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"CAPT-SR6","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16}]}]}
