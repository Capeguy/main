{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"UTC14%","description":"The global games industry has overtaken film and music in annual revenue. Its reach has also extended beyond children and teens to working adults, including women. This module evaluates board and digital games and their influence on culture and communities. How do games impact our health, relationships, businesses, and behaviour? Can they change the ways we learn, interact, and understand the world? What makes games engaging or even potentially addictive? We engage communities such as professional gamers and their audiences, game designers, entrepreneurs, and women in gaming, and explore the impact of emerging technologies such as Augmented and Virtual Reality.","title":"Jr Sem: Games, Game Communities and Society","department":"College of Alice and Peter Tan","faculty":"Residential College","workload":[0,3,0,3,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"UTC1416","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1630","endTime":"1930","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"CAPT-SR5","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":16}]}]}
