{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"The Global South, emerging from the Cold War era terminology of the âThird World,â is increasingly seen as an alternative to postcolonial or diaspora studies as a framework for studying supranational networks of exchange and co-operation. Combining readings in literary theory with an exhilarating romp through a number of contemporary novels, this course asks how the Global South is defined, what this framework offers students of literature, and what the Global South novel as a genre would look like. We investigate the hypothesis that the Global South novel is one that self-consciously works to imagine transnational subaltern connections or solidarity.","title":"The Global South Novel","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,3.5,6],"prerequisite":"YCC1111 Literature and Humanities 1 and YCC1112 Literature and Humanities 1; or with the permission of the instructor.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YHU4253","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":{"and":["YCC1111","YCC1112"]}}
