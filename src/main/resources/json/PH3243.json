{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"We often appeal to probabilistic notions in everyday life. We say things such as ‘It’ll probably rain later’, ‘It’s unlikely that an asteroid will collide with Earth any time\nsoon’, and ‘There’s a chance that the restaurant will be open’. But what exactly is probability? We shall investigate various answers to this question by looking\nat various theories of probability, including the subjective theory, the epistemic theory, the frequency theory, and the propensity theory. Along the way, we’ll\nsee how issues in the philosophy of probability bear on issues in the philosophy of science, metaphysics, and epistemology.","title":"Chance and Uncertainty","department":"Philosophy","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,0,7],"prerequisite":"PH2110/GEM2006 or PH2201/GEM2025 or PH2243 or PH3211","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PH3243","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"W1","startTime":"1500","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS3-0523","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS3-0523","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":25}]}],"prereqTree":{"or":["PH2110","GEM2006","PH2201","GEM2025","PH2243","PH3211"]}}
