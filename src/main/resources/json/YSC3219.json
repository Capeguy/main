Is there an algorithm for telling whether\nthe Android app that we are about to download is a malware? Can we be\nsure that, if intercepted, our emails cannot be read by unintended recipients? We will follow the path taken by Alan Turing, which will lead to some of the\nmost surprising discoveries in computer science. The course will cover\nvarious models of computation (finite automata, grammars, Turing\nmachines) and classic topics in computability/complexity theory (eg,\nundecidability, NPâcompleteness).","title":"Theory of Computation","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,5,4.5],"prerequisite":"YSC1202 Introduction to Computational Thinking and Programming for All\n(ICTPA), IS CS Module, or an equivalent course.","corequisite":"If you havenât taken math courses in which you have to do proofs, then YSC2209 Proof is strongly recommended.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSC3219","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":"YSC1202"}
