{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"The extraction, production, distribution and use of energy sources have significant environmental, social, political, and economic impacts. These impacts are multi‐scalar, ranging from global climate change to socio‐cultural disruption at the local and national scale. This module exposes students to these impacts with detailed case studies. The module also gives students a comprehensive background on the development and use of promising future postcarbon alternative energy sources such as wind, solar, geothermal, tidal, and biofuels. It also discusses how to build the architecture of a post‐carbon economy.","title":"Energy Futures: Environment and Sustainability","department":"Geography","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,2,0,2,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"GE2230","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT10","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":120},{"classNo":"DO2","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"AS2-0204","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"DO3","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"AS2-0204","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"DO4","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"AS2-0204","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"DO1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"AS2-0204","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30}],"examDate":"2019-11-30T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}]}
