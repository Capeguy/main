{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This course aims at presenting the fundamentations and\nimportant computational algorithms that are very related to\nimportant applications in visual information processing and\nanalysis: from image acquisition to processing, and to\ninterpretation/understanding. The emphasis is on the tight\nintegration of mathematical foundations, numerical\nalgorithms, and programming implementation techniques\nrelated to industrial applications.\n\nMajor topics include: fundamentals for pictorial data\nacquisition and processing, Computational method for 3D\nreconstruction, Visual data categorization and\nsegmentation, computational methods for visual learning\nand their applications in pattern analysis.","title":"Visual Data Processing and Interpretation","department":"Mathematics","faculty":"Science","workload":[4,0,0,2,4],"prerequisite":"MA4230 or departmental approval","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"DSA5203","attributes":{"ssgf":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1900","endTime":"2200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S17-0406","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30}],"examDate":"2019-12-03T05:00:00.000Z","examDuration":150}],"prereqTree":"MA4230"}
