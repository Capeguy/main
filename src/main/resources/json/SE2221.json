{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module introduces the variety of music in Southeast Asia, from traditional to pop, and contributes to students' understanding of the region. Lectures with audiovisual illustrations, which will emphasize cultural and contextual approaches, will be complemented by practical instruction in playing Javanese gamelan music. We will study the different musical aesthetics, changing cultural and social contexts and functions (from village and palace rituals to arts academies, the cassette industry, and concerts), musical and cultural interaction, and the changing musical ?landscape? of Southeast Asia. The course is appropriate both for students interested in Southeast Asian culture, and anyone who likes music.","title":"Old and New Music in Southeast Asia","department":"Southeast Asian Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,4,3],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"SE2221","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
