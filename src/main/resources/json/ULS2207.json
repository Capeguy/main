{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"When asked, “what is pain?” many respond: “the response to something painful.” That answer is tautological. To escape tautology, we need to understand pain independent of any stimulus; we need to understand pain subjectively. A subjective focus, however, causes \nproblems. The need for subjectivity might deny pain to the unborn and to animals, and seemingly leads to the conclusion that we can “think” ourselves into, and out of, pain. Consequently, many argue that pain should be understood objectively as the expression of biological changes (hormonal increases, brain activity) that are mobilised to defend the organism from injury.","title":"The Biology and Phenomenology of Pain","department":"University Scholars Programme","faculty":"University Scholars Programme","workload":[0,4,0,1,5],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"ULS2207","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
