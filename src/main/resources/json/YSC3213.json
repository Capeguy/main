{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"Experimental physics will provide students with handsâon practical experience using techniques to investigate scientific problems that draw on concepts from different branches of physics (e.g. quantum, statistical, thermal, solid state and optical). It aims to enhance their understanding and apply scientific knowledge learnt in class. Emphasis will also be placed on the development of analytical skills in measurement and analysis.","title":"Experimental Physics Laboratory","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,0,6,3,3.5],"prerequisite":"Minimum prerequisite of either YSC1207 General Chemistry or YSC1213 General Physics","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSC3213","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":{"or":["YSC1207","YSC1213"]}}
