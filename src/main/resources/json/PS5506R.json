{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This graduate module explains how the powerful forces or actors of globalization led to pro‐market neoliberal reforms in the nature of state formation and introduced changes in public governance (policy and administration). In particular, it analyses the neoliberal mode of public management, known as the reinvention or new public management (NPM) model. The module examines major elements of NPM ‐ type reforms (e.g.privatization, outsourcing, public‐private partnership, managerial autonomy, and financial decentralization) in East and Southeast Asia. It evaluates the impact of globalization‐led neoliberal reforms on democracy, citizen‐administration relations,and corruption by using a politic‐economic perspective on globalization, state formation, and governance.","title":"Globalization and Public Governance","department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,2,5],"moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"PS5506R","aliases":["PS5506"],"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS3-0304","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":5}]}]}
