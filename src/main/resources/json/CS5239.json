{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"The objective of this module is to provide students a working knowledge of computer performance evaluation and capacity planning. They will be able to identify performance bottlenecks, to predict when performance limits of a system will be exceeded, and to characterise present and future workload to perform capacity planning activities. Topics include: performance analysis overview; measurement techniques and  tools including workload characterisation, instrumentation, benchmarking, analytical modelling techniques including operational analysis, stochastic queuing network analysis; performance of client-server architectures; capacity planning; case studies.","title":"Computer System Performance Analysis","department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","workload":[2,1,0,3,4],"prerequisite":"(CS1020 or CS1020E or CS2020 or CS2030 or CS2113/T) and \n(EE2012/A or ST2132 or ST2334 or ((MA2216 or ST2131) and (ST1131/A or ST1232 or DSC2008)))","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"CS5239","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1830","endTime":"2030","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"COM1-0206","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"2030","endTime":"2130","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"COM1-0206","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":100}]}],"prereqTree":{"and":[{"or":["CS1020","CS1020E","CS2020","CS2030","CS2113","CS2113T"]},{"or":["EE2012","EE2012A","ST2132","ST2334",{"and":[{"or":["MA2216","ST2131"]},{"or":["ST1131","ST1131A","ST1232","DSC2008"]}]}]}]}}
