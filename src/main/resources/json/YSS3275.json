{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This course offers a window into the complex arrangements of social life in cities. It explores the ways in which social structures and dynamics are folded into and through urban contexts, specifically by imagining the city from four planes of social life. We examine (i) ‘cities of difference’ (ii) ‘cities of scales’ (iii) ‘cities of relations’ (iv) ‘cities of actions’. At the end of the course, students will gain clearer recognition of the darker structures in urban life, the complicity of society and culture in stabilising them, but also a deeper appreciation for spaces of hope that allow for change.","title":"Social Life of Cities","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,6.5,3],"prerequisite":"YSS2220 Introduction to Urban Studies or with the permission of the instructor.","corequisite":"YSS2220 Introduction to Urban Studies","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSS3275","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":"YSS2220"}
