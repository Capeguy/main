{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module introduces students to taxonomy and systematics; i.e., the science of grouping biodiversity into species, describing the species, and classifying this\ndiversity into higher-level taxa that reflect evolutionary history. The module has two main goals: (1) It introduces the main concepts and goals of taxonomy and\nsystematics. (2) It teaches the qualitative and quantitative techniques that are today used to describe/identify species and higher-level taxa based on the analysis of\nmorphological and DNA sequence evidence. The aim is to equip environmental as well as other biologists with a thorough understanding of taxonomic/systematic units and the tools needed for evaluating and quantifying diversity in samples of plant and animal specimens.","title":"Principles of Taxonomy and Systematics","department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","workload":[2,1,1,2,4],"prerequisite":"LSM3241 or LSM3252","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"LSM4254","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":{"or":["LSM3241","LSM3252"]}}
