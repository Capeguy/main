{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"While Asian waters are at the heart of our geopolitical world, from unending resource wars to widening biological hotspots, they have figured little more than linkages between lands in today’s area studies and regional histories. This course aims to help students better understand not only the historical web of human-ocean interactions in Southeast Asia but also the challenges that confront today’s regional society in the age of climate change.
