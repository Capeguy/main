{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"Nations talk about themselves through images and symbols. This module looks at American Icons â the images, figures, and institutions that represent the fundamental ideas, myths, symbols, and contradictions associated with the nation. Essentially, the module is about how people talk about and define the United States. We will look at how images and ideals about the US move and change and morph across time and space during the last 100 years. We will also look at the way ideas about the nation are represented and how they circulate inside and outside the United States.","title":"History of American Icons","department":"History","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,3.5,6],"prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in HY, or 28 MCs in GL or GL recognised non- language modules with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"HY4232","semesterData":[]}
