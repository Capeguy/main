{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"Singapore is a small postcolonial multicultural nation-state and a cosmopolitan global city. Its experience of rapid development led by a clean, elite, and pragmatic state has been codified into a model and in fact a nation brand, admired by developing and advanced countries alike. This module focuses on how Singaporeâs transformation into a top-rank global city has affected its policies surrounding social cohesion, urban development, social development, and foreign affairs. It examines the viability of the Singapore model in the face of complex global challenges, which may require fundamental adjustments to Singaporeâs strong state model.","title":"Governing Nation-State and Global-City Singapore","department":"LKYSPP Dean's Office","faculty":"LKY School of Public Policy","workload":[3,0,0,3,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PP5513","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1700","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LKY_TB10SR","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":90}]}]}
