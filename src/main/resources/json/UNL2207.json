{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"Not applicable to USP modules.","description":"This module examines the evolution of our present  theoretical understanding of some basic aspects of the physical world around us. It explores the role of certain\nprimitive concepts of science and how these key ideas have been used to construct a coherent ‘mental’ picture of the physical world. The particular focus this semester will be on a wellestablished and ‘deterministic’ law of nature: the Law of Universal Gravity and how this led to Newton’s prediction of the motion of the planets.\nThe module will also question, on a higher level, the nature of ‘scientific explanations’: how these are extended over time and inevitably get modified by having to take into account new ‘facts’ provided by observation and experiment.","title":"The Nature of Natural Law","department":"University Scholars Programme","faculty":"University Scholars Programme","workload":"2-2-0-0-3-3","prerequisite":"Not applicable to USP modules.","corequisite":"Not applicable to USP modules.","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"UNL2207","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
