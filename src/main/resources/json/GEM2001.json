{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"TS2232","description":"This module explores the historical trajectories of traditional Asian theatres and the ways in which they have evolved due to colonialism, nationalism and globalisation. Combining focused studies on traditional theatre forms and their contemporary iterations with cross-geographical comparison, this module provides the analytical tools to examine Asian theatres as they evolve. The traditional/contemporary dynamic will be further explored in practical sessions and thematic discussions, through the study of classical scripts, masks, stages, and costumes from Sanskrit drama, Noh theatre and Xiqu. Students interested in South Asian studies, Chinese studies and Japanese studies will benefit from this module.","title":"Asian Theatres: Tradition and the Contemporary","department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,2,5],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"GEM2001","attributes":{"su":true},"aliases":["TS2232"],"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS5-0309","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":1}]}]}
