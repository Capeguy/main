{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"EE4001, EG4301, CG4001","description":"This research capstone project provides students with an opportunity to work on a complex engineering problem with a strong element of investigative and exploratory research.    It requires   a   confluence   of   knowledge,   skills   and capabilities  in  project  management  and  communications. The project will involve a varied blend of research, design and  development  activities  and is  carried  out  over  two semesters. The project proposal can come from a faculty member  or  student.  It  may  arise  during  the  studentâs industrial  attachment  or  as  part  of  an  on-going  research project  and  may  involve  direct  industrial  and  research institutesâ  participation.  Students  will  be  assessed individually.","title":"Research Capstone","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[0,0,0,6,4],"prerequisite":"Level 4 standing","moduleCredit":"8","moduleCode":"EE4002R","attributes":{"year":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[]},{"semester":2,"timetable":[]},{"semester":3,"timetable":[]},{"semester":4,"timetable":[]}]}
