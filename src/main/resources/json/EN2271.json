{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module seeks to introduce the techniques and genres of contemporary playwriting in order to equip students with the skills and resources needed to write for the stage. Students' weekly writing exercises will be critiqued by their peers and will culminate in the writing (and rewriting) of their own one-act plays. Students will also analyse one or more contemporary plays each week from a practitioner's perspective. Techniques discussed will include creating characters, dialogue, and theatrical action. Genres examined will include the historical play, the political play, the farce, the play of ideas, and the comedy of manners.","title":"Introduction to Playwriting","department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,5,2],"prerequisite":"EL1101E or EN1101E or TS1101E or GEK1011 or GEK1000 or GEM1003.
