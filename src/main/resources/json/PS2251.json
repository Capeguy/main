{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"In this module, students will study postcolonial regions in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America. They will discuss questions such as: What makes a region? Who makes a region? How has the experience of colonialism shaped the region? What are the models of regional cooperation and integration, and whose models are they? How do regions âinteractâ with postcolonial global structures and dynamics? Students are encouraged to compare different regional experiences, and draw from this breadth of knowledge to critically evaluate the concepts and theories they will learn.","title":"The Region in the Postcolonial World","department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,2,5],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PS2251","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"D1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"AS1-0304","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS8-0401","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":75},{"classNo":"D2","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"AS3-0303","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25}],"examDate":"2019-12-03T05:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}]}
