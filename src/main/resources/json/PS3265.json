{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module surveys major themes and debates in the study of civilâmilitary relations. The study of civil military relations addresses a simple puzzle: can we\nhave a military strong enough to protect civilians yet not so strong as to ignore or subvert civilian authority? A military strong enough to defend the state from external enemies is also strong enough to seize power. How can a state have a strong military capability without being dominated by it? How do political leaders and military organizations interact with each other and with the larger society, and how do their cultures overlap and diverge.","title":"Civil-Military Relations","department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[1,2,0,2,5],"prerequisite":"Completed PS1101E","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PS3265","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100},{"classNo":"D1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"AS3-0304","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"E2","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[2,4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS1-0201","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[2,4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS1-0205","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"D2","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"AS1-0205","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25}]}],"prereqTree":"PS1101E"}
