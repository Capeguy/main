{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module offers students theoretical and applied understandings of mobilities as a productive site of social life and culture. Drawing perspectives from the ‘new’ mobilities paradigm, it demonstrates how movement is not a sterile activity or zone, but a space replete with meaning. To exemplify this point, this course takes transportation as a lens of analysis, and interrogates its socio‐cultural organization and experience. Three aspects will be emphasized, namely the identities and embodiments latent in transportation; the infrastructures of transit; and the (geo)politics of mobility. Case studies will be drawn internationally, including Asia.","title":"Mobile Spaces: Making Social Worlds","department":"Geography","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,4,5.5],"prerequisite":"Completed at least 80MCs, including 28MCs in GE, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\n(Global Studies students) \nCompleted 80MCs, including 28MCs in GE or 28MCs in GL/GL recognised non-language modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"GE4226","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1500","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS2-0302","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":50}],"examDate":"2019-11-27T09:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}]}
