{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"Discrete mathematics is the art of combining and arranging sets that are naturally composed of individual pieces, such as the integers, oneâs network of friends, or the internet. This course develops basic techniques for manipulating discrete sets through a host of concrete examples and applications. Key topics include permutations, partitions, recurrences, generating functions, networks, graph algorithms, and rigorous explorations of the Fibonacci and Catalan numbers, the Principle of Inclusion/Exclusion, the Pigeonhole Principle, and Pascalâs Triangle.","title":"Discrete Mathematics","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,4,0,0,8],"moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSC2213","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1500","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-PgRm1","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1500","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-PgRm1","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18}]}],"fulfillRequirements":["YSC3245"]}
