{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"Anthropologists have long argued against the radical separation of theory and method. Not only does ethnographic observation shape the knowledge it produces; anthropology’s commitment to an intersubjective world determines the kind of embedded observation, “thick description” and “grounded theory” that are its stock-in-trade. But what are ethnography and grounded theory in our late modern world, when many of the humanist assumptions on which anthropology was founded have come under critique - feminist, Marxist, queer, and postcolonial? Drawing on ethnographies past and present, this class will explore these questions through a close engagement with ethnographic texts, past and present.","title":"Ethnography as Theory and Method: Classical and Contemporary Readings","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,0,9.5],"moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSS4253","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-CR19","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18}]}]}
