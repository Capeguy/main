The course begins with an introduction to identity theory, and then explores concepts of human, male and female, self, national, racial, and social identities.  Common homework assignments - including readings and audio and video files - form the basis of class discussion and written exercises; this is not a lecture-based course.","title":"Art and Identity","department":"YSTCM Dean's Office","faculty":"YST Conservatory of Music","workload":[0,3,0,2,5],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"GEM1030","attributes":{"su":true},"aliases":["GET1047"],"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"YSTCM-SR6","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":30},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1300","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"YSTCM-SR6","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":30},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1300","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"YSTCM-SR6","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1100","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"YSTCM-SR6","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":30},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"YSTCM-SR6","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1100","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"YSTCM-SR6","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":30}]}]}
