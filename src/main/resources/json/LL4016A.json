{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"When the judges at the Nuremberg Tribunal handed down their decision against the German leaders in October 1946, they declared ‘crimes against peace’ – the initiation of aggressive wars – to be ‘the supreme international\ncrime’. At the time, the charge was heralded as a legal milestone, but subsequent events revealed it to be a postwar anomaly. This module traces the ebb and flow of the idea of criminalising aggression – from its origins after the\nFirst World War, through its high-water mark at the postwar tribunals and its abandonment during the Cold War, to its recent revival at the International Criminal Court.","title":"Topics in Int’l Criminal Law (A): Aggression","department":"FoL Dean's Office","faculty":"Law","workload":[0,3,0,0,7],"prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or its equivalent","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"LL4016A","semesterData":[]}
