{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"Biogeography, the study of where organisms live and why, is a multidisciplinary science central to evolutionary biology and conservation. It encompasses both historical and ecological factors and employs a wide range of analytical methods. This course will introduce key concepts of biogeography and ongoing developments such as molecular dating of biogeographic events and modelling of species occurrence in relation to global change. Students will explore one topic in detail, and work in a group to reference current literature, analytical methods, and online resources (e.g., specimen databases) to address a biogeographic question, and teach the cl ass about this. Many examples will pertain to Sundaland with particular emphasis on the relevance of biogeography to the discovery and conservation of biodiversity","title":"Biogeography","department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","moduleCredit":"2","moduleCode":"BL5210","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S2-0415","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":25},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S2-0415","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":25}]}]}
