{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module examines the ways power, space, and pleasure are interconnected. The module is divided into three units. First, we will look at how space is related to questions of power, focusing in particular on surveillance. Then, in the second unit, we will consider more closely the relation between space, power and pleasure as exemplified in voyeurism and surveillance : here we will be watching people watching other people. Finally, we'll consider the relations between space, power and pleasure in Singapore, in particular as this applies to the tensions between traditional practices and urban planning in city spaces here.","title":"Writing & Critical Thinking: Power, Space and Pleasure","department":"University Scholars Programme","faculty":"University Scholars Programme","workload":[0,4,0,0,6],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"UWC2101H","semesterData":[]}
