{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"For the past two centuries, the world has been organized around nation-states. Defined by language, culture, history, government, military power, and clear boundaries, a nation organizes how citizens run their lives and their businesses. More recently, the dominance of nations has been challenged – sometimes subtly, sometimes aggressively – by multinational companies, which can seem to exist above governments’ sway. The world of today – and of tomorrow – is caught in the intersection of these two forces. This course will look at this conflict from a variety of perspectives, utilizing insights from history, business, and other disciplines to explore phenomena and case studies.","title":"Empire, Country, Corporation: The Struggle for Control","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,2.5,7],"moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSS3288","semesterData":[]}
