{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"Evolutionary biology covers the history of life on our planet and the processes that produced the multiple life forms of Earth. Topics include: the origins of life, the eukaryotic cell, and multicellularity; the generation of genetic variation and the sorting of that variation through random processes and through natural and sexual selection; the origin of new traits, new life histories, and new species; the origins of sex, sociality, and altruism; the evolution of humans; and applications of evolutionary biology to solving modern-day problems.","title":"Evolutionary Biology","department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","workload":[4,0,0,2,4],"prerequisite":"GCE 'A' Level or H2 Biology or equivalent, or LSM1301 or LSM1301X","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"LSM1105","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT26","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":240},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT26","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":240}],"examDate":"2019-12-05T09:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT26","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":240},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT26","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":240}],"examDate":"2020-05-05T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"fulfillRequirements":["LSM4259","LSM3256","LSM3252","LSM2289","LSM2288","LSM2241"]}
