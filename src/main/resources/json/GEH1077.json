{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"More people live in cities now than in any other point in history: how does this change human culture and civilisations? Cities tell a story of our world; they are a testament to humankindâs ability to reshape the environment in lasting ways. They reveal how we interact with the environment and with each other. Cities are created in many forms and for many reasons ranging from defense, religion and economic activity. Through case studies this module examines urban history, lived experiences and how city life has changed over time.","title":"Metropolis: The City in World History","department":"History","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,0,7],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"GEH1077","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":4,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":{"start":"2020-06-22","end":"2020-07-27"},"venue":"LT10","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50},{"classNo":"W2","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":{"start":"2020-06-24","end":"2020-07-29"},"venue":"AS8-0401","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"W1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":{"start":"2020-06-24","end":"2020-07-29"},"venue":"AS8-0401","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25}]}]}
