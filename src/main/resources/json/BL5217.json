{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"The module will examine how genome-wide datasets can be applied to questions relating to the evolutionary history of animal and plant lineages. Some of the major topics discussed will be \n(1) genome-wide datasets used to entangle rapid radiations, \n(2) genome-wide SNPs deployed to discover patterns of gene flow between neighbouring lineages, \n(3) introgression and admixture across hybrid zones, and many more.","title":"Population Genomics and Phylogenomics","department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","workload":[0,2,0,8,10],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"BL5217","attributes":{"ssgf":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S2-0414","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S2-0414","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50}]}]}
