{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"Using short stories, novellas, TV shows and films, this class\nexamines the art of detective writing and traces the narrative\ncomplicity of the detective and urban space. The detective moves\nbetween different social spaces within the city, with access to both\npenthouses and crack dens, and the city itself becomes a character\nin these tales â alternatively helpful, seductive, sullen, and\ndangerous. Part of the syllabus will be dedicated to texts originating\nin the Global South, asking how the genre of detective fiction\nchanges when it encounters the postcolonial city.","title":"Mean Streets: The Detective and the City","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,4,5.5],"moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YHU2294","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1030","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-PgRm2","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":19},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1030","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-PgRm2","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":19}]}]}
