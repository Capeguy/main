{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"PL3260 Moral Development","description":"Do the babies come into the world with innate moral sense? How do they come to know right from wrong? Which factors may shape children’s moral development? The module will introduce the origins, development and cognitive processing of morality. The module will cover the early theories of moral development, the contemporary developmental research on infants’ and children’s moral judgment and moral behavior, and the influence of society (eg. parents, peer, media) on children’s moral development. Through lectures, discussions, readings, and essay writing we will analyze and debate whether morality is innate, adaptive, and unique from other aspects of cognitive development.","title":"Moral Development","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[2,3.5,0,3,4],"prerequisite":"YSS2201 Understanding Behaviour and Cognition","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSS4221","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":"YSS2201"}
