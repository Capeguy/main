{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This course is aimed at doctoral students who intend to conduct experimental and quasi-experimental research for the study of individualsâ behavior in business (e.g., marketing, organizational behavior) and related disciplines (e.g., psychology). Topics include factorial designs, repeated (within-subject) and mixed designs, analysis of covariance, and mediation analysis. Importantly, the course examines these designs and analyses from the perspective of an applied behavioral researcher, not from that of a statistician. That is, the course emphasizes the actual use of proper data collection procedures and analyses techniques for rigorous theory testing instead of focusing on statistical theory per se.","title":"Experimental Methods for Behavioral Research","department":"BIZ Dean's Office","faculty":"NUS Business School","workload":[0,3,0,4,3],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"BZD6012","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1500","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"BIZ2-0114","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":30}]}]}
