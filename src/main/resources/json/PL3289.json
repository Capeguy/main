Topics to be covered include the decoy effect, framing effect, ambiguity aversion, delay discounting, fairness, game theory, and cooperation. We will review seminal and most recent research on these topics and discuss implications for understanding human decision making in real-life situations. Students will then work in small groups to design and conduct an experiment using these methodologies/paradigms and submit individual research reports.","title":"Lab in Decision Science","department":"Psychology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,0,3,4,3],"prerequisite":"PL1101E, PL2131, PL2132 and PL3235","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PL3289","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS7-0201","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":25}]}],"prereqTree":{"and":["PL1101E","PL2131","PL2132","PL3235"]}}
