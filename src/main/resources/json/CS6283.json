We will discuss broadly four problems: Boolean Satisfiability (SAT), Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT), Constrained Counting, and Knowledge Compilation. We will discuss how automated reasoning tools for the above problems can be employed to reason for models that require combination of data and background knowledge.","title":"Advanced Topics in Computer Science: Logic in AI","department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","workload":[2,0,0,4,4],"prerequisite":"CS3230 Design and Analysis of Algorithms and (ST2334 Probability and Statistics or ST2131 Probability)","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"CS6283","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":{"and":["CS3230",{"or":["ST2334","ST2131"]}]}}
