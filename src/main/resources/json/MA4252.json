{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"The field of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is a fundamental area in mathematics. There is a great range of real-world phenomena to which the theory and methods of ODEs can be applied. The central aim of this course is to study the qualitative aspects of ODEs. Major topics: Review of firstorder non-linear equations (including continuous dependence on initial conditions). Linear systems, periodic systems, asymptotic behaviour. Stability theory, stable, unstable and asymptotically stable solutions. Lyapunovâs direct method. Two dimensional autonomous systems, critical points, phase portrait, limit cycles and periodic solutions, Poincare-Bendixson Theorem.","title":"Advanced Ordinary Differential Equations","department":"Mathematics","faculty":"Science","workload":[3,1,0,0,6],"prerequisite":"MA3220","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"MA4252","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1700","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S17-0611","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S17-0611","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":25},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S17-0611","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":25}],"examDate":"2019-12-05T09:00:00.000Z","examDuration":150}],"prereqTree":"MA3220","fulfillRequirements":["MA5252"]}
