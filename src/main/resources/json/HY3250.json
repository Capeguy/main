{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module is aimed at students who wish to deepen their understanding of Singapore history through an examination of different representations of history: (a) academic scholarship, (b) social memory and oral history, (c) heritage. Each section will incorporate fundamental concepts and debates behind the production of history, together with the application of these ideas to specific Singapore case studies. At the end of the course, students will be able to critically analyse Singapore history as a whole in terms of historiography and heritage studies, whilst gaining familiarity with the treatment of key issues in Singaporeâs past.","title":"Approaches to Singapore History","department":"History","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,2,5],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"HY3250","semesterData":[]}
