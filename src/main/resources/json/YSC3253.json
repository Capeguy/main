{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"Known as the ‘rainforests of the sea’ coral reefs occupy <0.1% of the world’s oceans yet they contain 25% of all the planet’s marine species. Unfortunately, the very existence of coral reefs is threatened by climate change. In this module students will gain an appreciation for coral reefs, their ecology, the evolutionary process responsible for creating this incredible biodiversity, and the threats that climate change and humans pose to these fragile ecosystems. Additionally, we will examine sustainable practices and lifestyle choices that can help reduce human impact on these essential marine habitats.","title":"Coral Reef Ecology and Environmental Change","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,3,6.5],"prerequisite":"YSC2247 Ecology and Ecosystems, YSC2216 Evolutionary Biology, or YID2209 Biogeophysical Systems.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSC3253","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1730","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-PgRm1","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1730","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-PgRm1","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18}]}],"prereqTree":{"or":["YSC2247","YSC2216","YID2209"]}}
