{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"Spintronics is the study of the intrinsic spin of the electron and its application in spin-logic and devices, spin-polarized injection devices, and storage media.  This is important for a variety of current and emerging applications in magnetic memories.  This course equips students with essential knowledge of magnetism, and exchange interactions in solids; half metals, and dilute magnetic semiconductors; spin injection, transport and detection; and magnetic nanostructures, and their applications in: GMR read-write heads, MRAM, spinFET, spin-torque oscillators.","title":"Magnetism and Spintronics","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","workload":[3,1,0,1,5],"prerequisite":"PC3235, PC4240, and PC4241 or equivalent modules approved by the lecturer or Department Approval","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PC5204","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S11-0204","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S11-0204","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30}],"examDate":"2019-11-25T05:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"prereqTree":{"and":[{"or":["PC3235","PC4240"]},"PC4241"]}}
