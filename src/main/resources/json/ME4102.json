{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"Standards provide requirements, specifications, guidelines or\ncharacteristics that can be used consistently to ensure that\nproducts, processes and services are fit for their purposes.\n\nWe aim to create awareness of, demonstrate and teach\nvarious standards currently used in mechanical engineering\npractices. In this module, three key categories in mechanical\nengineering are selected, namely smart manufacturing,\nsustainable energy and medical technology. After giving a\nbroad overview of the standards landscape in mechanical\nengineering, it will focus on the standards associated with\nthe 3 identified categories. They will be discussed in\nlectures, industrial talks by experts, student group\ndiscussions/projects etc.","title":"Standards in Mechanical Engineering","department":"Mechanical Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[2,2,0,4,2],"prerequisite":"ME3162 Manufacturing Processes","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"ME4102","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"B1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E3-06-09","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":35},{"classNo":"B2","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E3-06-09","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":35},{"classNo":"A1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E5-03-20","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":35},{"classNo":"C1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E3-06-05","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":35},{"classNo":"B1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E5-02-32","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":35},{"classNo":"C2","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E3-06-05","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":35},{"classNo":"A2","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E3-06-07","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":35},{"classNo":"B2","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E5-02-32","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":35},{"classNo":"C1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E1-06-03","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":35},{"classNo":"C2","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E1-06-03","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":35},{"classNo":"A1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E3-06-07","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":35},{"classNo":"A2","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E5-03-20","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":35}]},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"B1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E5-03-19","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Packaged Tutorial","size":40},{"classNo":"A1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"EA-06-06","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Packaged Tutorial","size":40},{"classNo":"A2","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"EA-06-06","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Packaged Tutorial","size":40},{"classNo":"B2","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E5-03-19","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Packaged Tutorial","size":40},{"classNo":"C2","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E1-06-07","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Packaged Tutorial","size":40},{"classNo":"XA2","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E5-03-20","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Packaged Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"XC2","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E1-06-09","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Packaged Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"XB1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"EA-06-03","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Packaged Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"XB2","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"EA-06-03","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Packaged Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"C1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E1-06-07","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Packaged Tutorial","size":40},{"classNo":"XA1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E5-03-20","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Packaged Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"XC1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E1-06-09","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Packaged Lecture","size":40}]}],"prereqTree":"ME3162"}
