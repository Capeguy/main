{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"With the growing influence of Data Science, the Statistics and Mathematics domains now require specific skills in programming, using domain-specific systems and libraries. This course introduces common tools for  Data Science programming. This includes a high-level language (i.e. Python), several Statistics/AI libraries (i.e. numpy, sklearn), and database systems (i.e. SQL). In addition we will create awareness of best practices in programming such as control versioning, testing, and continuous integration.","title":"Programming for Data Science","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,6,3.5],"prerequisite":"YSC1212 Introduction to Computer Science or with the permission of the instructor.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSC2244","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-CR22","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18}]},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1900","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-CR18","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18}]}],"prereqTree":"YSC1212"}
