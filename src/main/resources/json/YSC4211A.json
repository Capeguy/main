{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This course fulfils one of the upper division requirements for the Life\nScience Major.\n\nThis course aims to be an advanced research seminar examining the latest\nfindings in Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology. The focus will be on analysis of primary literature. Students will work on scientific writing and presentation.\n\nThe seminar topic is on Heredity & Epigenetics in Semester 2 AY2018/2019. This course will combine evolutionary thinking and high-end molecular, cellular, and epigenetic papers from the primary literature, to get students to think about the role of the environment in creating heritable modifications, in the form of epigenetic marks or transmitted miRNAs, that might bias or impact organismal evolution.","title":"Adv Topics Molecular, Cell Bio: Heredity & Epigenetics","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,4,0,0,8.5],"prerequisite":"At least one required :\nYSC3233 Molecular Cell Biology OR\nYSC3238 Developmental Biology, OR\nYSC2233 Genetics OR\nYSC3214 Biochemistry OR\nWith the permission of the instructor","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSC4211A","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":{"or":["YSC3233","YSC3238","YSC2233","YSC3214"]}}
