{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This course will examine some fundamental issues in parallel programming and distributed computing, and the relationships between the two.  Parallel programming: mutual exclusion, semaphores, consistency, wait-free synchronization.  Distributed computing: time, global state, snapshots, message ordering.  Relationships: consensus, fault-tolerance, transactions, self-stabilization.","title":"Parallel and Distributed Algorithms","department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","workload":[3,0,0,3,4],"prerequisite":"CS3230 Design and Analysis of Algorithms or CS3210 Parallel Computing","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"CS4231","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1830","endTime":"2030","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"COM1-0212","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":80},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"2030","endTime":"2130","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"COM1-0212","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":80}]}],"prereqTree":{"or":["CS3230","CS3210"]},"fulfillRequirements":["CS5233","CS6213"]}
