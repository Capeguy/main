{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module will explore an advanced topic in epistemology in depth. Some possible topics are the problem of scepticism, including realist and antiârealist\nresponses to it, the nature of certainty and the relationship of knowledge to chance and credence, the internalism versus externalism debate about the\nnature of knowledge and justification, and the definability of knowledge in terms of truth, belief, justification and their cognates. The module may also explore a problem from formal epistemology, such as the lottery paradox, the problem of logical omniscience, or probabilistic approaches to the problem of induction.","title":"Advanced Epistemology","department":"Philosophy","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,0,7],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PH6211","semesterData":[]}
