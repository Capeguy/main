{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"In the contemporary world, philosophy is one academic discipline among many. But throughout its history, philosophy has also been conceived as a way of life. This course will explore this alternative conception of philosophy by exploring pre-modern Greco-Roman and Chinese models, and contemporary reflections on the philosophical life. Topics include the relation between theoretical discourse and one’s lived life; philosophy and living well;philosophy as a way of life and “religion”; protreptic arguments for pursuing philosophy; therapeutic arguments; spiritual exercises; and the extent to which this conception of philosophy remains viable today.","title":"Philosophy as a Way of Life","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,0,9.5],"prerequisite":"YCC1114 Philosophy and Political Thought 2","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YHU2279","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":"YCC1114"}
