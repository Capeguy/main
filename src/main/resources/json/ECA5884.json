{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This course provides an introduction to the field of behavioural economics. In the first part of the course, we will familiarize students with specific\nempirical problems of the standard model in economics, which assumes that individuals are fully rational, act consistently over time, and are strictly\nselfish. We will show how departures from these assumptions can be modelled and integrated into economics analysis. In the second part, we will show how this approach can be put to use. We will study how policy interventions can be made more effective, for example in resource conservation, retirement savings, and humanâresource practices.","title":"Applied Behavioural Economics","department":"Economics","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,2,5],"prerequisite":"ECA5101 Microeconomics\nECA5103 Quantitative & Computing Methods","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"ECA5884","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1830","endTime":"2130","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":60}]}],"prereqTree":{"or":["ECA5101","ECA5103"]}}
