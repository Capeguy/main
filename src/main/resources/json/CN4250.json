{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"Many chemical companies are moving towards higher value-added specialty chemical products from commodities. This module prepares students with the\nexpertise of (higher-value-added) chemical product design for such  companies. It covers the basic methodology with illustrative examples from many areas such as active ingredients and personal-care products. The module involves active-learning lectures and student teaching (with feedback from the lecturer and peers) so that students will gain competence of thinking divergently and critically, and confidently solving open-ended problems through group discussion.","title":"Chemical Product Design","department":"Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[2.5,1,0,3.5,3],"prerequisite":"CN2116: Chemical Kinetics and Reactor Design\nCN3132: Separation Processes\nCN3135: Process Safety, Health and Environment","corequisite":"EG2401/EG2401A: Engineering Professionalism","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"CN4250","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1100","endTime":"1300","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E5-03-19","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":48},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E5-03-19","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":48}]},{"semester":3,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":{"start":"2020-05-15","end":"2020-06-19"},"venue":"E5-03-19","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":48},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":{"start":"2020-05-11","end":"2020-06-15"},"venue":"E5-03-19","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":48},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1500","weeks":{"start":"2020-05-15","end":"2020-06-19"},"venue":"E5-03-19","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":48},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1500","weeks":{"start":"2020-05-11","end":"2020-06-15"},"venue":"E5-03-19","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":48}]}],"prereqTree":{"and":["CN2116","CN3132","CN3135"]}}
