{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"Todayâs most widely-known, international concert repertoire is primarily made up of 18th-, 19th-, and early 20th-century European and North American composers and their music. This module presents a look, listen, and study of their music and legacy focusing on two parallel movements in the European tradition: the classical, rococo, galante, emfindsamer stil, and neo-classical; and sturm und drang, romantic, and neo-romantic. The focus of learning in this course is through primary source materials. (Non-conservatory students that can read music are invited to enrol in this course as free elective.)","title":"Classical Styles and Romantic Spirits","department":"YSTCM Dean's Office","faculty":"YST Conservatory of Music","workload":[0,3,0,4,3],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"MUH2201","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
