{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"GEH1010","description":"How do ideas about big beasts and the wild inform our socio‐cultural worldview? In other words, what is a “tiger” when it is not just a zoo animal but one that lives in a forest next to your home? In this introductory and interdisciplinary course to conservation and the environment, we will watch films and discuss novels and ethnographies focusing on human/animal relations in six different spheres: Mountains, Deserts, Rivers, Plains, Forests, and Sea. The course aims to be an informative, provocative and fun introduction to an exciting and relatively new field of scholarship.","title":"Beasts, People and Wild Environments in South Asia","department":"South Asian Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,3,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"GEM1913","attributes":{"su":true},"aliases":["GEH1010"],"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"E2","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS4-0206","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":1},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS7-0119","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":1},{"classNo":"D2","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"AS3-0215","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":1},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"UTSRC-LT51","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":4},{"classNo":"D1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"AS3-0303","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":1}]}]}
