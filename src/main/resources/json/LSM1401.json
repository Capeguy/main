Upon completing this module, the student is expected to have sufficient knowledge in fundamental life processes in order to appreciate and relate the importance of biochemistry in industry as well as in everyday life. The student should also be well prepared to take up higher level modules for which biochemistry is the prerequisite.","title":"Fundamentals of Biochemistry","department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","workload":[2,0.5,1,0,6.5],"prerequisite":"GCE 'A' Level or H2 Chemistry or equivalent, or CM1417 or CM1417X","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"LSM1401","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT27","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":400},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT27","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":400}]}],"fulfillRequirements":["BN4501","BN3402","BN3301","CN4233R","CN2108","LSM2101","LSM2103","LSM2102","CM4227"]}
