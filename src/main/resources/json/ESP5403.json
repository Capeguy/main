{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module starts with highlighting the importance of\nnanomaterials in the context of energetics, electrical\ntransport and thermal behaviour. Later it will deal with\ndifferent energy systems using nanostructured materials\nfocusing on the energy conversion as well as energy\nstorage. Course closes with various engineering aspects,\nsafety issues and related challenges to be faced in the\ndevelopment of miniaturised energy devices using\nnanostructured materials.","title":"Nanomaterials for Energy Systems","department":"Engineering Science Programme","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[3,1,1,1,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"ESP5403","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"EA-06-05","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"EA-06-05","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40}],"examDate":"2019-12-05T09:00:00.000Z","examDuration":150}]}
