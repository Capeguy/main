{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module invites the student to reflect critically on the ways the past is established, experienced and represented in the present. The objective is to foster an appreciation of history as a dynamic undertaking in which not only academics but societies as a whole participate. The module is comprised of a theoretical core and changing case studies that touch on media representations, museology and conservation, historiography and the philosophy of history. CA projects afford students the opportunity to experience first-hand how history, far from being confined to libraries and archives, is part of daily life. While the module targets primarily History majors, its cultivation of critical skills in the analysis of written and visual texts is relevant to students from all faculties.","title":"Memory, Heritage & History","department":"History","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,2,5],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"HY3226","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS5-0202","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS7-0119","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"E2","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS3-0302","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20}],"examDate":"2019-11-29T06:30:00.000Z","examDuration":120}]}
