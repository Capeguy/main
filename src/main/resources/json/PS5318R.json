{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module explores the politics of authoritarian rule. It begins by investigating conceptual and operational differences between authoritarian and democratic regimes. It then proceeds to examine the question of âwho governsâ in authoritarian regimes, looking in particular at personalist, monarchical, military, and single party regimes. Further topics include: conditions that give rise to authoritarianism; strategies of maintaining power; authoritarianism and economic growth; and domestic and international sources of authoritarian demise. Readings will cover theoretical approaches to the study of authoritarian rule and inâdepth (mainly qualitative) case studies.","title":"The Politics of Authoritarian Rule","department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,3,4],"moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"PS5318R","semesterData":[]}
