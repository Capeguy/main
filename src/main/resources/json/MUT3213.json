{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module begins with an overview of Beethoven’s music and his influence on contemporaneous and later 19th century composers.\n\nThe heart of this course explores the divide between absolute and programme music. ‘Leipzigerisch’ composers (Mendelssohn, Schumann, Brahms) versus the ‘New German School’ (Berlioz, Liszt). Nationalism is included.\n\nThe final weeks are devoted to the Opera genre by examining the works of Wagner, Verdi and Puccini. It extends to Strauss and Mahler, who represent the final flowering of musical Romanticism. With the model of a Romantic composer/performer, Romantic Styles is designed to bridge compositional work with performance, supported by interpretative analysis.","title":"Romantic Styles","department":"YSTCM Dean's Office","faculty":"YST Conservatory of Music","workload":[1,2,2,3,2],"prerequisite":"MUT1101: Introduction to Musical Concepts and Materials 3 Core Compositional Engagement (Theory) Electives and/or permission of the instructor","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"MUT3213","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"YSTCM-SR8","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":15}]}],"prereqTree":"MUT1101"}
