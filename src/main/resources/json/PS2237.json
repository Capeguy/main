{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"Designed as an introductory theoretical module, it covers the basic concepts of International Relations in two halves. The first introduces the concepts of nation, state, sovereignty, non-state actors and their implications for the coexistence of nation-states, as well as a brief roundup of the instruments of conducting relations among them. The other offers a grounding in the major schools of thought on International Relations, namely realism, liberalism/pluralism and revolutionism. Additionally, there will be topics on radical perspectives such as feminism, constructivism and postmodernism. It is hoped the module will provide students with a foundation for other courses in the sub-field.","title":"Introduction to International Relations","department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,2,5],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PS2237","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT12","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150},{"classNo":"D3","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"AS3-0214","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS1-0211","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"E2","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS3-0306","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"D2","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"AS1-0205","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"D1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"AS3-0214","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"E3","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS1-0211","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25}],"examDate":"2019-11-30T05:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"fulfillRequirements":["PS3880F","PS3251"]}
