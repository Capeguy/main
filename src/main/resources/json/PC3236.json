{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"The module presents basic computational methods useful for physics and science students. The lectures cover: (1) Basic numerical methods - differentiation, integration, interpolation, root-finding and random number generators, (2) Differential equations - finite difference method, shooting method and relaxation method; applications to chaotic dynamics of a driven pendulum, one-dimensional Schr&#246;dinger equation, and fast Fourier transform, (3) Matrices - Gaussian elimination scheme for a system of linear equations, eigenvalues of Hermitian matrices;  Hartree-Fock approximation, (4) Monte Carlo simulations - sampling and integration; random walk and simulation of diffusion equation, stochastic differential equation, Brownian dynamics; variational Monte Carlo simulation; Metropolis algorithm and Ising model, and (5) Finite element methods - basic concepts; applications to the Poisson equation in electrostatics.","title":"Computational Methods in Physics","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","workload":[3,1,0,1,5],"prerequisite":"Students who have passed PC2134 or equivalent","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PC3236","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S16-0436","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":60},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S16-0436","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":60}],"examDate":"2020-04-28T05:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"prereqTree":"PC2134","fulfillRequirements":["PC5215","PC3238"]}
