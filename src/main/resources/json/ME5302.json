{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This graduate level module introduces students to the application of numerical methods for solving incompressible fluid flow and convective heat transfer problems. Major topics covered include: review of theory of numerical discretisation/approximations numerical techniques for elliptic and parabolic PDEs; conservation form; finite-volume discretisation; boundary layer problems; solving Navier-Stokes equations in streamfunction-vorticity and primitive-variables formulations; SIMPLE/R and related procedures; Artificial Compressibility Method; Marker-Cell procedures; steady-state, transient and pseudo-transient methods/approaches. Knowledge in fluid dynamics and heat transfer is presumed. Theory is reinforced by mini-projects. The module is recommended for students who intend to pursue graduate research that requires the application of CFD.","title":"Computational Fluid Mechanics","department":"Mechanical Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[3,0.5,0,4,3],"prerequisite":"ME2135","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"ME5302","attributes":{"grsu":true},"semesterData":[],"prereqTree":"ME2135"}
