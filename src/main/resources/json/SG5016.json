However, when combined with other business process improvements, and coupled with judicious use of technology, organisations can sometimes revolutionise their business transformation.\n\nThis course shows how a mix of business methods and technology can be ingredients in the process of change; and the ability of organisations to manage such a change is the basis for business transformation.
