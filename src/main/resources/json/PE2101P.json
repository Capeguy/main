{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module will introduce students to PPE as a multidisciplinary endeavour, by showing them how social and political philosophy can be done in a way that is strongly informed by the findings of social science. The course will be organized around discussing a few specific issues â such as inequality, nudging, climate change, and the formation of the state. Analysing these issues will introduce students to the methods and results of philosophy, political science, and economics, and show how they could be integrated to better understand and tackle social and political phenomena.","title":"Introduction to Philosophy, Politics, and Economics","department":"Philosophy","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,0,7],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PE2101P","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"D1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"AS4-0604","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"D2","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"AS3-0523","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS4-0604","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50}]}]}
