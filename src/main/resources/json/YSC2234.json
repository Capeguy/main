{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"YSC1201 (previous module code)","description":"This module examines selected aspects of human anatomy and physiology from an evolutionary framework.  The module begins with a birds-eye view of organ systems and their integration, organized around a limited number of simplifying themes.  Deeper explorations will be made into a small number of human adaptations, exploring selection, maladaptation to modern living, and human variation.  The module is intended to be accessible to students for whom this is their first college-level science course and to be of value to anyone interested in human biology, regardless of major.","title":"Human Biology","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[1,3,0,0,8.5],"moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSC2234","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1030","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-GLRm2","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1030","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-GLRm2","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1030","endTime":"1130","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-GLRm2","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18}],"examDate":"2019-12-03T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":180}]}
