{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"It has been widely acknowledged that the People’s Republic of China is no longer a communist state. At the same time, scholars have criticized popular images of the PRC as a failed socialist state and the authoritarian, anti-liberal (somehow therefore anti-Western) ‘other.’ This cultural history course examines China’s political, economic, and intellectual transformations of the 1980s and 1990s to challenge the notion of China as a monolithic entity. We interrogate the promises and perils of “postsocialism” as an adequate concept to address the emergent forms of labor, gender, and artistic exploitation in China.","title":"Goodbye Mao: China's Post Socialist Transformations","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,0,9.5],"moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YHU3336","semesterData":[]}
