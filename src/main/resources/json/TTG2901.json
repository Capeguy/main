It aims to develop students to be 'able communicators' with a holistic and humane view of engineering.\n\nStudents are expected to work towards becoming critical decision makers, creative problem solvers, effective communicators, and responsible professionals. The course will focus on developing audience-centred oral communication skills, and students will be given opportunities to critically analyze communicative texts and events, and perform effective and ethical communication practices in various situations. The course also helps develop students' ability to effectively communicate engineering practices to both technical and non-technical audience.","title":"Communications for Engineering Professionals","department":"SCALE Dean's Office","faculty":"Cont and Lifelong Education","workload":[1,2,0,4,3],"prerequisite":"Completed at least 40MCs of programme requirements excluding APC.","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"TTG2901","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"2030","endTime":"2130","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E1-06-01","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2030","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E1-06-01","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1900","endTime":"2130","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E1-06-14","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20}]}]}
