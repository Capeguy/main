{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"GEM1004","description":"For the first six weeks, students read three dialogues by the ancient Greek philosopher, Plato: Euthyphro, Meno, and Republic, Book I. These readings touch on a wide range of topics: mind and morals; politics and psychology; metaphysics and science. For the second six weeks, students will meet with the same problems, ideas and arguments, but as they manifest in the writings of various contemporary figures – philosophers and non-philosophers: psychologists, political scientists, public policy experts. \n\n‘Reason and Persuasion’ is a generic title.

Plato worried about this; so will we.","title":"Reason and Persuasion","department":"Philosophy","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[3,1,0,2,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"GET1027","attributes":{"su":true},"aliases":["GEM1004"],"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100},{"classNo":"E3","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS3-0302","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"E5","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS4-0604","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS3-0302","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"E2","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS1-0211","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"E4","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS8-0402","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20}]}]}
