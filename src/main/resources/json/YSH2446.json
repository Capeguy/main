{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This special seminar identifies, examines, and explores, pathways through which individuals and organizations might champion effective “global environmental governance” strategies.\n\nTo accomplish this task the course is organized into five session. Session I: transnational pathways, assesses how practitioners might draw on global initiatives to influence ‘on the ground’ challenges in domestic settings. Session II identifies ‘bottom up’ path dependent policy interventions capable of gaining strength over time, and spreading outward. The course will apply these pathway frameworks to globally relevant forest and climate challenges including C02 emissions, deforestation, and forest degradation. We will focus specifically on understanding how international cooperation over climate in general, and the December 2015 Paris climate agreement’s emphasis on “Nationally Developed Contributions” in particular.","title":"Global Environmental Governance: Pathways for Sustainable Outcomes","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,12,0,0,24],"moduleCredit":"1","moduleCode":"YSH2446","semesterData":[]}
