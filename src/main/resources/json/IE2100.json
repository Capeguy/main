{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"DBA3711","description":"The module builds upon the foundation in ST2131 and stresses on applications of stochastic modeling. Topics include: Review of exponential distribution; Conditional probability and conditional expectation; discrete time Markov chains; Poisson process; Basic queuing models and continuous time Markov chains and Renewal Theory. Students will eventually be conversant with the properties of these models and appreciate their roles in engineering applications.","title":"Probability Models With Applications","department":"Industrial Systems Engineering and Management","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[3,1,0,3,3],"prerequisite":"ST2334\nor EE2012 \nor CE2407\nor BN2102","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"IE2100","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT2","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1500","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"EA-06-04","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"EA-06-05","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"EA-06-05","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30}],"examDate":"2020-05-04T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"prereqTree":{"or":["ST2334","EE2012","CE2407","BN2102"]},"fulfillRequirements":["IE3120","IE3100M","IE3110R","IE4243","IE4299","IE4239","IE3110","IE4220"]}
