{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"UTS2709 or UTC27%","description":"Energy in Singapore depends mainly on imported fossil fuels/petroleum/natural gas. Obviously, in the quest for alternatives, future energy demand and mix, some challenges/dilemmas arise naturally in Singapore context: would nuclear energy deployment be feasible? Is wind energy a viable option? would a complete switch to solar, biofuels, and waste-to-energy technologies be possible? This module offers a systems and system dynamics approach to deal with such issues and the corresponding dynamics, dilemmas and decisions that arise while addressing them. Students gain insights into the political, socio-economic and environmental aspects of these challenges through relevant case studies/models.","title":"Energy and Singapore: Dynamics, Dilemmas and Decisions","department":"Residential College 4","faculty":"Residential College","workload":[0,3,0,4,3],"prerequisite":"GEM1918 or GEM1919 or UTC1700 or UTC1701 or UTC1702%","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"UTC2718","attributes":{"su":true},"aliases":["UTS2709"],"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1900","endTime":"2200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"RC4-SR3","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":8}]},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1900","endTime":"2200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"RC4-SR1-2","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":10},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1900","endTime":"2200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"RC4-SR1-2","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":10}]}],"prereqTree":{"or":["GEM1918","GEM1919","UTC1700","UTC1701","UTC1702"]}}
