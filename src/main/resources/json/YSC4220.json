{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"Previous code YSC3230 Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations","description":"Much of modern science and mathematics is expressed in the language of differential equations. Population models in ecology, financial growth, heat conduction, and water waves are a few examples. In this course, you will solve the classical linear ordinary and partial differential equations.\n\nStudents will assemble a toolbox of mathematical techniques to solve initial and boundary value problems, including integrating factors, separation of variables, and Fourier series.","title":"Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,4,0,0,8.5],"prerequisite":"Both YSC2232 (previously coded YSC3205) Linear Algebra and YSC3240 Foundations of Applied Mathematics, Or with the permission of the instructor.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSC4220","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":"YSC2232"}
