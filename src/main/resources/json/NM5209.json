{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This course will cover major artistic threads, such as networked art, that involve large numbers of geographically distributed participants, large-scale public works as well as virtual and augmented reality works that blur the distinction between real-world and synthetic information. The course will focus on interactive works where media consumers participate in creating their own artistic experience. It will also cover the historical development of ideas, put them into a social context and examine contemporary critical reflections about art. The course will culminate in the study of several works by some of the most important emerging new media artists.","title":"Interactive Media Arts","department":"Communications and New Media","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[3,0,0,3,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"NM5209","semesterData":[]}
