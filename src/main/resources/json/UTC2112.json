{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"With a focus on Asia, this course draws on a diverse range of literatures (history, anthropology, psychology, animal activism) to provide a broad context for understanding the dynamics and conflicts between humans and animals. Southeast Asia is one of last regions in the world with extensive rain forest habitat for wild animals, but these creatures are threatened by burgeoning urbanization and agriculture. We will go beyond a focus on wildlife conservation, however, to also look at âurban animalsâ such as pets and farm animals, and other topics which are\ncentral to life in this part of the world, and others.","title":"Animals and the City","department":"Tembusu College","faculty":"Residential College","workload":[1.5,1.5,0,8,19],"prerequisite":"This four-week intensive module is intended only to be offered in the summer term.\n\nEnrollment will be offered to a select group of students, half of them from our IARU and Tembusu College partner residential colleges/university, and the others from NUS.
