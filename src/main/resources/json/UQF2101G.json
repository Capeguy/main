{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"Not applicable to USP First-Tier modules.","description":"This topic-based module develops quantitative reasoning skills through a structured analysis of an important but accessible problem, imparting to students the appreciation that, for many questions/issues, a quantitative analysis can \nprovide the insight and clarity that complements and moves beyond what might be gained through a qualitative approach.  \n\nThis module focuses on quantifying aspects of nuclear risks. Students will pose a question related to nuclear risks (e.g. What is the lowest dose of radiation that can lead to cancer?), propose a method to measure the relevant variables, collect the necessary data, and make scientifically justifiable inferences from it. Students will thus perform all aspects of a genuine scientific study, from problem formulation to decision making and final reporting.","title":"Quantitative Reasoning Foundation: Quantifying Nuclear Risks","department":"University Scholars Programme","faculty":"University Scholars Programme","workload":[0,4,0,3,3],"prerequisite":"Not applicable to USP First-Tier modules.","corequisite":"Not applicable to USP First-Tier modules.","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"UQF2101G","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"USP-TR1","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":25},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"USP-TR1","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":25}]}]}
