{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"World systems theorists have formulated models of an economically interlinked world from the early modern period on, but the globalism of an earlier, premodern period of roughly a thousand years, 500-1500 CE—also known as the “Middle Ages”—is still insufficiently understood.\nWorld systems, moreover, emphasize the economic at the expense of the sociocultural. To sustain the social and cultural analysis of early globalisms, “Early Global Literatures and the World, 500-1500 CE”—a transhumanities course—closely examines human interactions across the planet in the longue durée through the focus of key literary-historical global texts.","title":"Early Global Literatures and the World, 500-1500 CE","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,2,7.5],"prerequisite":"YCC1111 Literature and Humanities 1 & YCC1112 Literature and Humanities 2 or with the permission of the instructor.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YHU3287","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":{"and":["YCC1111","YCC1112"]}}
