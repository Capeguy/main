{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"SC6211A","description":"This seminar will examine the complexities and the challenges to global social order and peace. With global transformation and the emergence of an interdependent world society, there has been a proliferation of risks. From ecological crises to the intensification of poverty, social inequality and social exclusion to the conflicts and violence on ethnic and religious lines have made the world a risky place. Theories of globalization will be applied to examine the social contexts and consequences of these crises, risks and violence. Globalization will be viewed as a complex process of cultural clashes intersecting with modern economy and polity. Using an inter-disciplinary framework, the seminar will explore the possibilities of minimizing risks and violence in a new global social order.","title":"Global Transformations","department":"Sociology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,3,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"SC6212","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1830","endTime":"2130","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS1-0212","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":25}]}]}
