{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"Birds are widely studied and constitute a model for many scientific disciplines from genetics to ecology. This module explores bird biology from an evolutionary perspective. Topics include: (1) birdsâ dinosaur origins; (2) present-day diversity with emphasis on Asian bird families; (3) evolutionary processes that may have led to avian flight, small genome size and other avian traits; and (4) challenges birds face in Earthâs modern extinction crisis. \n\nThis module is suitable for students passionate about biological processes ranging from organismic evolution at the molecular level to broad ecological and biogeographic contexts.","title":"Avian Biology and Evolution","department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","workload":[2,1,1,2,4],"prerequisite":"LSM2252","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"LSM3266","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S1A-0217","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":70},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1800","weeks":[2,4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"S2-03LAB7","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":70}],"examDate":"2019-11-29T06:30:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"prereqTree":"LSM2252"}
