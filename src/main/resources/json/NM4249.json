{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"As old media (radio, film, TV) passes through the process of digitisation, so its audience is implicated in this transformation. This module investigates the complex disruptions in national identities, media texts and institutions via the media production and policies that shaped them, and how the digital changes allows us to understand audience reception. Audiences are both the trigger and the beneficiaries of this change. As part of an ongoing larger dialogue between media and society, this module makes sense of these changes, by investigating the interstice of this media trajectory with special emphasis on television texts and audiences.","title":"Media & Audiences","department":"Communications and New Media","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,5,4.5],"prerequisite":"Cohort 2012 onwards: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in NM, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"NM4249","semesterData":[{"semester":3,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1500","endTime":"1800","weeks":{"start":"2020-05-12","end":"2020-06-16"},"venue":"AS4-0119","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1500","endTime":"1800","weeks":{"start":"2020-05-14","end":"2020-06-18"},"venue":"AS4-0119","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":30}]}]}
