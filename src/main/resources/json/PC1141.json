{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"STUDENTS WHO HAVE PASSED PC1431 OR PC1431FC or PC1431X OR PC1433 ARE NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE THIS MODULE.","description":"This module presents the fundamental principles of classical mechanics. It covers such topics as kinematics, Galilean transformation, Newton's laws of motion, dynamics of a particle with generalization to many particle systems, conservation laws, collisions, angular momentum and torque, motion of a rigid body, gravitation and planetary motion, static equilibrium, oscillatory motion and vibrational modes, waves, Doppler's effect and fluid mechanics. The module also has a practical component consisting of five experiments designed to enhance students' understanding of some of the concepts discussed in lectures. This module is targeted at science students who wish to acquire a working knowledge of mechanics, and is an essential for physics majors.","title":"Introduction to Classical Mechanics","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","workload":[3,0.5,1.5,2,3],"prerequisite":"âA' level or H2 pass in Physics or PC1221/PC1221FC/PC1221X & PC1222/PC1222X","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PC1141","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1300","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"S11-0301","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT20","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":120},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT20","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":120},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1700","weeks":[5,7,9,11],"venue":"S12-0402A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":16},{"classNo":"4","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1400","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"S11-0301","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"4","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1700","weeks":[5,7,9,11],"venue":"S12-0402A","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":16},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1700","weeks":[5,7,9,11],"venue":"S12-0402A","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":16},{"classNo":"7","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1700","weeks":[6,8,10,12],"venue":"S12-0402A","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":16},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1300","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"S11-0301","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1400","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"S11-0301","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"8","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1700","weeks":[6,8,10,12],"venue":"S12-0402A","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":16},{"classNo":"6","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1700","weeks":[6,8,10,12],"venue":"S12-0402A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":16}],"examDate":"2019-12-04T05:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120},{"semester":2,"timetable":[],"examDate":"2020-04-27T05:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"fulfillRequirements":["PC2289","PC2288","PC2193","PC2132"]}
