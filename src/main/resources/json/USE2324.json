Cognizing this, the field of Ecological feminism [Ecofeminism] has grown rapidly in the past few decades.\n\nThis introductory module to ecofeminism will combine literary analysis, environmental humanities and feminism. It will extend studentsâ knowledge of feminism and environmental issues relating to women. Fundamental to the study will be the literary analysis of texts taught in a scaffolded way.
