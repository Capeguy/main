{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This course teaches how to use the programming language R for analyzing and presenting statistical data. Starting from the fundamentals of R (data types, flow control), students learn how to write their own R scripts and functions. They learn how to extract data from web sites and bring the input into a shape (e.g. using regular expressions) that is suitable for further analysis. Much of the course will focus on Râs graphics features, including network representations and geographic maps. The objective is to present data in ways that are informative, elegant and fun (e.g. as short animated video clips).","title":"Data Analysis and Visualization (DAVis) with R","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,2,2,4,4.5],"prerequisite":"YCC1122 Quantitative Reasoning","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSC2210","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":"YCC1122","fulfillRequirements":["YSC4212"]}
