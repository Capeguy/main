{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"CE5604","description":"This module provides students with in-depth knowledge on\nthe role of constituent materials of concrete such as\ncements, mineral admixtures, and chemical admixtures and\ntheir interactions that affect properties of fresh and\nhardened concrete. It also provides students with in-depth\nknowledge on concrete response to stresses, timedependent\ndeformations, and durability of concrete\nexposed to severe environments. The module discusses the\nbasic considerations and design philosophy for\nperformance-based design of concrete mixtures and\nproduction of concrete. It also discusses the progress in\nconcrete technology and the latest development on highstrength,\nhigh-performance, lightweight, and self\ncompacting concrete. Sustainable development in\nconstruction industry and use of recycled aggregates and\nother recycled materials will be discussed as well. The\nmodule is targeted at post-graduate and final year\nundergraduate students who will gain knowledge from the\nmodule to complement their skill in structural design and to\nprepare them for their career as professional engineers.","title":"Advanced Concrete Technology","department":"SCALE Dean's Office","faculty":"Cont and Lifelong Education","workload":[3,0,0,2,5],"prerequisite":"TCE2155","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"TCE5604","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":"TCE2155"}
