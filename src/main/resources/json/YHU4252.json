{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This course invites students to engage the garden as a starting point for creative research and artistic production. In cities, gardens provide one of the most intimate experiences many people have with more-than-human ecologies sometimes known as “nature.”  We will take a multi-sensory and multi-media approach, experimenting with drawing, photography, and multimedia projects as ways to observe, represent, and imagine the ways humans relate to the rest of life in an age of environmental urgency. Readings, discussion, and artistic critique will also play an integral part of our collective investigation as students cultivate a body of work at semester’s end.","title":"Culturing Nature: Ecological Art and the Garden","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,3,6.5],"prerequisite":"All Year 1 Common Curriculum modules and YHU2291 Intro to the Arts; or with the permission of the instructor for other students of broad backgrounds.\n\nTraining in basic (observational) drawing is preferred.
