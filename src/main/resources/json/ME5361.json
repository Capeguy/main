{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This is an advanced module on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) at the graduate level. The module introduces some newly-developed numerical techniques for simulation of fluid flows as well as convective heat transfer problems. Major topics covered in this module include: high-order numerical approaches for solving boundary-layer and Navier-Stokes equations; boundary integral method for linear systems; upwind and Godunov-type schemes for compressible flow simulation; lattice Boltzmann method for incompressible flow simulation. There is a compulsory Term Paper project for this module. The module is recommended for research students and engineers who intend to do research project in the CFD area.","title":"Advanced Computational Fluid Dynamics","department":"Mechanical Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"ME5361","attributes":{"grsu":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E1-06-04","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":60}],"examDate":"2020-04-29T09:00:00.000Z","examDuration":150}]}
