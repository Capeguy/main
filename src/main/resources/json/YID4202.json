{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"The seminar, restricted to environmental-studies majors, is an applied, interdisciplinary exploration of a contemporary environmental challenge. Students conduct research, perform necessary analysis, and present their findings to relevant stakeholders. The seminar heightens studentsâ ability to conceptualise and analyse knotty problems, fosters an ability to communicate effectively across disciplines, and develops research skills for the capstone project. The module is offered in semester one of each academic year and is required of all 3rd-year environmental-studies majors. Fourth-year majors will be admitted only under unusual circumstances (e.g. declaring the major late or an urgent need to study away in semester one of a studentâs third year), subject to approval by the Head of Studies.","title":"Applied Environmental Research","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,3,6.5],"prerequisite":"Open only to Environmental Studies majors, and required for all 3rd-year majors in the program.
