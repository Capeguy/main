{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module covers the principles and characteristics of heterogeneous, homogeneous and enzymatic catalysis. Reaction cycles are analysed at the molecular level, and a microkinetic approach is used to describe the processes. Selected industrial processes and commercial devices are discussed to illustrate practical applications of the studied topics.","title":"Catalysis","department":"Chemistry","faculty":"Science","workload":[4,1,0,2,3],"prerequisite":"CM2121","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"CM4228","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT31","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":80},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT31","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":80},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1000","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S8-0314","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":80}]}],"prereqTree":"CM2121"}
