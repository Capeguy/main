In doing so, we highlight\nnegative and positive advertising effects from\ncommunicative, psychological, cultural, sociological, and\npolitical perspectives. Various social and ethical\nimplications of advertising on society in general, and on\nvarious vulnerable populations, such as children,\nminorities, and women, in particular are also discussed.\nThe module promotes approaches to manage advertising\ninfluences through active citizen participation to achieve\na more enlightened society.","title":"Critical Perspectives in Advertising","department":"Communications and New Media","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,4,3],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"GET1035","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"NAK-AUD","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":120},{"classNo":"W3","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1100","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"ERC-SR10","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"W4","startTime":"1100","endTime":"1200","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"ERC-SR10","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"W2","startTime":"1500","endTime":"1600","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"TP-SR8","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"W6","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1400","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"UTSRC-SR5","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"W1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1500","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"TP-SR8","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"W5","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1300","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"UTSRC-SR5","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20}],"examDate":"2019-12-02T05:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"W5","startTime":"1700","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"ERC-GLR","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"UTSRC-LT52","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":120},{"classNo":"W3","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1300","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"ERC-GLR","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"W1","startTime":"1500","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"ERC-GLR","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"W2","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1700","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"ERC-GLR","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"W4","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"ERC-GLR","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"W6","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1500","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"ERC-GLR","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20}]}]}
