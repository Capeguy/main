It is structured to contain substantial design and development of hardware and software components.\nThis module is the culminating point of a series of modules integrating the theories which students have already learnt in CS1010, CS2040C, CG2028, CG2271 and CS2113/T. With this capstone project, students would be able to better appreciate the relevance of the various components in the Computer Engineering curriculum to large scale computer engineering projects.","title":"Computer Engineering Capstone Project","department":"Computing and Engineering Programme","faculty":"Multi Disciplinary Programme","workload":[1,0,3,14,2],"prerequisite":"CG2028 Computer Organization and CG2271 Real-Time Operating Systems and CS2113/T Software Engineering & Object-Oriented Programming","moduleCredit":"8","moduleCode":"CG4002","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT3","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E4A-04-08","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":60},{"classNo":"02","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1700","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E4A-04-08","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":60}]}],"prereqTree":{"and":["CG2028","CG2271",{"or":["CS2113","CS2113T"]}]}}
