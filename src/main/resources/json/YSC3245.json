{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"In Operations Research (OR), we apply mathematical methods to model and solve decision-making problems from a wide range of domains, including Management or Engineering. This module will provide students with a broad overview of common problems and techniques from OR. In addition, there will also be continues practices of problem modelling and solving in order to build a solid knowledge of the field.","title":"Operations Research and Applications","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,4,0,5,3.5],"prerequisite":"YSC1212 Introduction to Computer Science and YSC2213 Discrete Mathematics or with the permission of the instructor.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSC3245","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":{"and":["YSC1212","YSC2213"]}}
