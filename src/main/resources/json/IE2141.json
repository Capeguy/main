It will provide students with an\nunderstanding of systems thinking and applying systems\ndynamics modelling to describe and simulate real world\nproblems. At the end of the course, students should have\nthe necessary knowledge and abilities to define, analyse,\ndesign, and develop a system dynamics model that\nsimulates a specific problem and recommend solutions for\ndifferent scenarios.","title":"Systems Thinking and Dynamics","department":"Industrial Systems Engineering and Management","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[2,3,0,3,2],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"IE2141","semesterData":[]}
