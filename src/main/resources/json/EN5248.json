{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"From Shakespeare’s Shylock to Kafka’s Gregor Samsa, Lu Xun’s Ah-Q and Sinha’s Animal, it could be said that “rejects” abound in literature. This module is an inquiry into the affective forces of such literary rejects, such as their ability to generate empathy within both readers and other textual characters, or to elicit from the latter a sense of “poetic” justice beyond existing juridicial norms, as well as how they complicate the literary “I” or subject. Texts read in the module will include Shakespeare’s Merchant of Venice, Kafka’s “Metamorphosis,” Lu Xun’s “The Real Story of Ah-Q,” and Indra Sinha’s Animal People.","title":"Literary Rejects","department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,0,7],"prerequisite":"Must be registered as a Graduate student in the university or with the approval of the Department.","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"EN5248","semesterData":[]}
