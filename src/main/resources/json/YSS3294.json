{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This course familiarizes students with the scientific study of culture from a social psychological perspective. The first third of the course orients us to what we mean by âcultureâ and develops a vocabulary to discuss various dimensions of culture. The second third of the course explores classic findings from the cultural psychology literature. The final third of the course takes a step back to ponder the origins of culture, considering insights from cultural psychology, evolutionary psychology, and (fiction) literature. Students are expected to actively contribute to seminar discussions, write regular response papers to assigned readings, and write two term papers.","title":"The Science of Culture: How and Why Are We Different?","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,2,10],"prerequisite":"YSS2216 Statistics and Research Methods for Psychology and YSS3278 Social Psychology; or with the permission of the instructor.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSS3294","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":{"and":["YSS2216","YSS3278"]}}
