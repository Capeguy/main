By 1939, movie studios were churning out masterpieces like Gone with the Wind and The Wizard of Oz. The intervening decade was perhaps the most transformative in the history of the cinematic medium. We will study the major events that form the backdrop for groundbreaking innovations in American filmmaking, including the Dust Bowl, the Great Depression, Prohibition, and the rise of Fascism and Nazism in the lead-up to World War II, as well as watching movies from the era and doing original archival research.","title":"Hollywood in the 1930s","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,2,7.5],"prerequisite":"All mandatory Common Curriculum modules:\nYCC1111 Literature and Humanities 1\nYCC1113 Philosophy and Political Thought 1\nYCC1122 Quantitative Reasoning\nYCC1121 Comparative Social Inquiry\nYCC1112 Literature and Humanities 2\nYCC1114 Philosophy and Political Thought 2\nYCC1131 Scientific Inquiry 1\nYCC2121 Modern Social Thought\nYCC2137 Scientific Inquiry 2","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YHU3312","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1730","endTime":"1900","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-CR4","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1730","endTime":"1900","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-CR4","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18}]}],"prereqTree":{"or":["YCC1111","YCC1113","YCC1122","YCC1121","YCC1112","YCC1114","YCC1131","YCC2121","YCC2137"]}}
