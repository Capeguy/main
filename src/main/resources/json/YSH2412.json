{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"A predominant pattern in Western epics has been the ”Novel of Formation”\n(Bildungsroman) – the novel that follows an individual through the stages of\nher life. The last century has seen a radical reversal. Instead of narrating a\nlife’s development, the new novel concentrates on the institution that\nshapes individuals and renders them subjects (school, bureaucracy, court of\nlaw etc.). The German‐Czech writer Kafka is the master of the new genre. The\ncourse highlights Kafka’s “The Trial” as a “novel of institution” while drawing\non related works including “The Castle,” and exploring concepts such as\n“institution,” “novel,” “form of life.”","title":"Short Course: Franz Kafka - The Novel of Institution","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":"12-24","moduleCredit":"1","moduleCode":"YSH2412","semesterData":[]}
