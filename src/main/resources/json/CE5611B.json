{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"The primary objective of this module is to equip civil engineers with sufficient design knowledge and skills on precast structural concrete both for their further education and for their future engineering career. This module provides participants with fundamental approaches in designing precast concrete\ncomponents and structures. The participants will acquire fundamental knowledge and approaches to section analysis and design, design of connections, floor diaphragm action, precast frame structures and precast components. The module is targeted at practising civil engineers and those with a keen interest in precast concrete technology.","title":"Precast Concrete Design","department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[1,0,0,0.5,3.5],"prerequisite":"Background in Structural Concrete Design","moduleCredit":"2","moduleCode":"CE5611B","attributes":{"lab":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1700","weeks":{"start":"2020-05-02","end":"2020-05-16"},"venue":"E4-04-03","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2100","weeks":{"start":"2020-05-21","end":"2020-05-21"},"venue":"LT1","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40}]},{"semester":3,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1700","weeks":{"start":"2020-06-13","end":"2020-06-20"},"venue":"E1-06-08","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40}]},{"semester":4,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1700","weeks":{"start":"2020-06-27","end":"2020-06-27"},"venue":"E1-06-08","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2100","weeks":{"start":"2020-07-06","end":"2020-07-06"},"venue":"LT1","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40}]}]}
