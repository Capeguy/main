{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"YSC2204 Fundamentals of Programming","description":"We cover basic data structures and algorithms with an emphasis on\nimplementation, although theory (asymptotic analysis, including\namortization) is also covered. Topics include lists, queues, stacks, unionfind,\nbinary heaps, red-black trees, hashtables, tries, binary search,\nefficient quicksort, graph representations, depth-first and breadth-first\nsearch, topological sort, Dijkstra’s, Prim’s and Kruskal’s, Huffman coding,\nand Knuth-Morris-Pratt. Additional topics may include:\n- Randomization (e.g. Bloom filters, Miller-Rabin, Rabin-Karp)\n- Time-space tradeoffs (e.g. range queries)\n- Parallel considerations (e.g. Map/Reduce, prefix-sum, quicksort)\n- Purely functional data structures (e.g. of red-black trees)\n- Approximation algorithms (e.g. vertex covering)\n- More sophisticated data structures and algorithms (e.g. leftist\nheaps, binomial heaps, splay trees)","title":"Introductory Data Structures and Algorithms","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,0,9.5],"prerequisite":"YSC1212 Introduction to Computer Science or with the permission of the\ninstructor","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSC2229","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-CR18","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18}]}],"prereqTree":"YSC1212","fulfillRequirements":["YSC3203","YSC3208","YSC3225","YSC3248"]}
