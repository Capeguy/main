{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module covers the principles of statistics in relation to biophysics and bio soft materials. It focuses on: modeling of biomacromolecular structure and statistical complexities; molecular mechanics of biomolecules; statistical models for structural transitions in biopolymers, statistical physical  description of structural transitions in macromolecules,  simulation of macromolecular structure, structural transitions in polypeptides and proteins; coil-helix transitions; prediction of protein secondary and tertiary structures; statistics of structural transitions in  polynucleotides and DNA; modeling of non-regular structures of biomacromolecules. This module is targeted at both physics and non-physics students who already have basic knowledge in physics, thermodynamics and molecular biology.","title":"Biophysics III","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","workload":[3,1,1,2,3],"prerequisite":"Students who have passed either PC3267 or Departmental Approval","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PC4267","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S12-0403","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S12-0403","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40}],"examDate":"2019-12-02T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"prereqTree":"PC3267"}
