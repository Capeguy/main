{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module will give students sound knowledge and appreciation of the development of plant-wide control (PWC) systems for chemical processes. The course will cover the systematic design of a regulatory control system with the aid of heuristics and computer-aided simulation tools. Students will be introduced to dynamic (real-time) simulation of chemical processes. Active learning techniques will be employed throughout. As part of the assessment, students will get to work hands-on with a project to design and simulate PWC systems for a chemical plant. Students are also assessed by means of a class test, and small individual assignments.","title":"Control of Industrial Processes","department":"Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[2.5,1,0,3.5,3],"prerequisite":"CN3121: Process Dynamics and Control\nCN4122: Process Synthesis and Simulation","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"CN4221R","attributes":{"lab":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT4","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1500","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT4","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":100},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT4","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100}]},{"semester":3,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1500","endTime":"1600","weeks":{"start":"2020-05-14","end":"2020-06-18"},"venue":"LT1","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":100},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1500","weeks":{"start":"2020-05-12","end":"2020-06-16"},"venue":"LT1","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1500","endTime":"1600","weeks":{"start":"2020-05-12","end":"2020-06-16"},"venue":"LT1","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":100},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1500","weeks":{"start":"2020-05-14","end":"2020-06-18"},"venue":"LT1","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100}]}],"prereqTree":{"or":["CN3121","CN4122"]}}
