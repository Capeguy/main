{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module focuses on refashioning identity by the usage of clothes. It\nalso focuses on the history of dress across Southeast Asia during the\ncolonial, post-colonial and early modern periods (late eighteenth to early\ntwentieth centuries). We will explore the way in which the dress of\nvarious Asian elites expressed notions, traditions, ethnic differences,\nidentity, and political power during these historical periods. Hybridized\ndress styles between “traditional” and “modern” were used as political\ntools in reaction to the intense cultural interactions and colonial\nexpansion, as well as the global cosmopolitan influence of the Victorian\nway of life.\nStudents will study history, political and sociology theories.\nThere will be field trips to examine textiles and clothes in private\ncollections and major museums in Singapore.","title":"The Politics of Dress in Pre-Modern Southeast Asia","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,3,6.5],"prerequisite":"YHU2291 Introduction to the Arts OR with the permission of the instructor","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YHU4230","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":"YHU2291","fulfillRequirements":["YHU4207"]}
