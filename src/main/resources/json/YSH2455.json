{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This seminar will introduce the storytelling tradition that originated in the Sanskrit poem Mahabharata (ca. 400 BC), “the great story of the Bharata clan.” Said to be the world’s longest epic, it is one of the foundational texts of South and Southeast Asian civilization, and has remained a living tradition continually re-presented in verbal, visual, and performance media and reinterpreted in changing historical and cultural contexts. An ultimate “game of thrones,” it has everything: sex, violence, and enlightenment, as well as reflections on big philosophical and ethical questions—all of which we will (briefly) explore through texts, images, and performances.","title":"Mahabharata: India’s Epic of Apocalypse and Renewal","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,10.5,0,0,24.5],"moduleCredit":"1","moduleCode":"YSH2455","semesterData":[]}
