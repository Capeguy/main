{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"The students will become familiar with the practice and history of two major theatre forms, one from the Euro-American tradition and one from Southeast Asia. We will study these forms through practical workshops, seminar discussions and a fieldtrip to Indonesia. In the second part of the module, the students will devise their own intercultural theatre projects, which will draw from both of the forms studied. In addition to this practical exercise, we will also read the theories of intercultural theatre practice and reflect more general about the challenges and opportunities presented by intercultural exchanges. Although the module focuses on theatre, the idea is to think creatively and critically about the complexities of intercultural communication in an increasingly globalized world.","title":"Intercultural Exchanges through Theatre","department":"University Scholars Programme","faculty":"University Scholars Programme","workload":[0,4,0,2,4],"prerequisite":"Not applicable to USP First-Tier modules. \nUSP Advanced modules (Course-Based Modules, CBMs) may state general pre-requisite skills/knowledge.
