{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module aims to provide fundamentals and methods of of process synthesis and simulation, which are required for design of chemical processes/plants. Students learn a heuristic method for process development, simulation strategies, main steps in process design and rigorous process simulation using a commercial simulator through both lectures and many hands-on exercises. They will also learn detailed mechanical design of process equipment, cost estimation and profitability analysis of chemical\nprocesses.","title":"Process Synthesis and Simulation","department":"Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[2,2,0,1.5,2],"prerequisite":"CN2116: Chemical Kinetics and Reactor Design\nCN2121: Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics\nCN3124: Particle Technology\nCN3132: Separation Processes\nor\nCN2116: Chemical Kinetics and Reactor Design\nCN2121: Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics\nCN2122/CN2122A: Fluid Mechanics\nCN3132: Separation Processes","moduleCredit":"3","moduleCode":"CN4122","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E5-03-24","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":39},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E5-03-24","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":39},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E2-0306PC3","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":39},{"classNo":"5","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E2-0306PC3","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":39},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1100","endTime":"1300","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT6","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":250},{"classNo":"4","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E2-0306PC3","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":39},{"classNo":"6","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E2-0306PC3","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":39}],"examDate":"2019-11-23T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":45},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E5-03-24","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E5-03-24","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E5-03-20","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":80}],"examDate":"2020-05-05T09:00:00.000Z","examDuration":30}],"prereqTree":{"and":["CN2116","CN2121"]},"fulfillRequirements":["CN4221R","CN4123R","CN4123"]}
