{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"The Sharing Economy (a.k.a. Collaborative Consumption or Peer Economy), describes the development of new business models or platforms, through the coordinated exchanges between individuals, that disrupt traditional markets by redefining industry categories, lowering transaction costs, and maximizing the use of scarce resources. We will explore how sharing economy platforms transform the way we live: how we consume, how we work, and how we trust. Finally, we evaluate the policy responses of governments, to mitigate potential threats to our social compact as a result.","title":"Life, Disrupted: The Sharing Revolution","department":"Economics","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,4,3],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"GEH1075","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"D01","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"AS8-0402","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"D02","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"AS1-0207","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"E02","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS1-0207","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT11","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100},{"classNo":"E01","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS8-0402","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25}],"examDate":"2019-11-28T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[4,6,9,11,13],"venue":"AS3-0303","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"E2","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[4,6,9,11,13],"venue":"AS1-0207","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"D1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[3,5,8,10,12],"venue":"AS3-0303","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"D2","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[3,5,8,10,12],"venue":"AS1-0207","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25}]}]}
