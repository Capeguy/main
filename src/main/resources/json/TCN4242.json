{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"CN4242E","description":"Students will learn the basic theories, methods and software for formulating and solving optimization problems relevant to chemical processes. They will study various methods of linear, nonlinear and mixed-integer linear programming, which would enable them to select and use appropriate algorithm and/or software for solving a given problem. They will also execute the various steps in optimization by solving selected practical problems via various case studies as well as a term project. This is for undergraduate students who wish to learn optimization \nmethodology to solve real-life problems in research and chemical industry.","title":"Optimization of Chemical Processes","department":"SCALE Dean's Office","faculty":"Cont and Lifelong Education","prerequisite":"TCN2411 & TCN3421","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"TCN4242","aliases":["CN4242E"],"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"2030","endTime":"2130","weeks":{"start":"2020-01-13","end":"2020-04-20"},"venue":"E5-03-21","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":10},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2030","weeks":{"start":"2020-01-13","end":"2020-04-20"},"venue":"E5-03-21","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":10}]}],"prereqTree":{"and":["TCN2411","TCN3421"]}}
