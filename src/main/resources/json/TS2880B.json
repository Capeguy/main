{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module trains students in the fundamental principles of Jerzy Grotowskiâs approach to the actorâs craft. It is conducted full-time over a short period, in the pedagogy of an intensive physical process needed to develop embodied knowledge. Students learn principles of organicity, relation, contact, impulse, intention, action and reaction. They examine the relation between process and form, in order to arrive at reflexive understanding of the difference between performing movement and action. Through the physical training exclusively developed by the Workcenter of Jerzy Grotowski and Thomas Richards, they practice singing ancient songs and develop individual and collective acting scenes.","title":"Grotowski's Approach to the Actor's Craft","department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,3,4],"prerequisite":"Priority will be given to TS majors and Yale-NUS students.
