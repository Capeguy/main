{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"GEK1059","description":"With special reference to Singapore, this module examines English – especially its standard form - as the leading global linguistic and cultural resource for intra- and inter-cultural communication.  Students use a variety of tools to analyse language in terms of phonetics, lexis, grammar, and meaning in context. We ask questions such as the following: (1) Why does the idea of ‘standard language’ appeal to human cultures?; (2) What does ‘standard English’ comprise?;  (3) What happens to the shape of English when local culture is blended in?  (4) Are ‘native speakers’ really native?;  (5) Does 'Standard Singapore English' exist?","title":"Standard English Across Cultures","department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,3,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"GEH1052","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
