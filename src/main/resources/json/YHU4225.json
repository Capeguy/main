{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"YHU3253 (previous module code)","description":"This course studies historical figures who were treated as “outlaws” or outsiders during an era of intensive European colonialism. Alternatively celebrated and maligned, pirates, privateers, prostitutes, and criminals all captured the popular imagination. These social types emerged amidst tremendous upheavals, which were triggered by imperial expansion. During the semester, we will study the legal regimes that identified certain people as dangerous and the coercive labour regimes that emerged to control them, from the poor laws to transportation and impressment. We will also consider what the popularity of “outlaw” figures in print culture reveals about changing social, gendered and sexual norms.","title":"Imperial Outlaws: Social Deviants in the Age of Empires","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,2.5,7],"prerequisite":"Students must have taken one 2000-level, 3000-level, or 4000-level history course prior to enrolment.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YHU4225","semesterData":[]}
