{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"Climate change -perhaps the defining issue of the 21st century- is a highly complex problem that requires interdisciplinary collaboration to develop policy responses. This course explores the science of climate change and uses theories from multiple disciplines, including law, political science, economics, and earth and atmospheric sciences to frame solutions to this global challenge. Through the application of quantitative tools (e.g. climate modelling, atmospheric and earth sciences) and qualitative tools (e.g. global environmental governance theory), students will establish an understanding of the causes and impacts of climate change, as well as the policy options and responses to address it.","title":"Climate Science and Policy","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,4.5,5],"prerequisite":"YID1201 Introduction to Environmental Studies or permission of the instructor.
