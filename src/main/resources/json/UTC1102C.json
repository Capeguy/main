By critically examining what it means to designate an object, practice or person as ‘fake’, and how different kinds of fakes are judged as more or less problematic, students will develop the capacity to think critically and relationally about deep-seated human desires for ‘truth’ and ‘value’.","title":"Junior Seminar: Fakes","department":"Tembusu College","faculty":"Residential College","workload":[0,3,0,3,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"UTC1102C","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1900","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"TC-SR3","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":16}]}]}
