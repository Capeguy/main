In practice this sequence is generated from some physical source of randomness, but a sample from such sources does not contain independent random bits.\nThis motivates the study of pseudorandomness, the theory of efficiently generating objects that “look random” despite being constructed using little or no randomness. This module will study the intimate connections between a variety of fundamental “pseudorandom objects” that at first seem very different in nature: expander graphs, randomness extractors, list-decodable error-correcting codes, samplers, and pseudorandom generators.","title":"Topics in Computer Science VI: Pseudorandomness","department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","workload":[3,0,0,3,4],"prerequisite":"CS3230 Design and Analysis of Algorithms and (ST2334 Probability and Statistics or ST2131 Probability)","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"CS6285","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":{"and":["CS3230",{"or":["ST2334","ST2131"]}]}}
