{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"GEM3903","description":"A UROP involves the student working with a supervisor, and sometimes in a team, on an existing research project. A CAPT UROP may focus on research  related to a \nparticular aspect of life, education or organization at the College. Alternatively, students may participate in research led by a College Fellow or other academic,  as long as the project gives the student exposure to forms of expertise and/or interests that go beyond any particular discipline. The aim of the UROP is to \nhelp support a studentâs academic and professional development through a meaningful research apprenticeship. The UROP is a graded module.","title":"CAPT Undergraduate Research Opportunity (UROP)","department":"College of Alice and Peter Tan","faculty":"Residential College","workload":[0,0,0,8,2],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"UTC3401","attributes":{"urop":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[]},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":1},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":1}]}]}
