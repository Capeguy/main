{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"Focusing on the so-called Bildungsroman, or novel of development, this course covers a form of novel that emerged in the late 18th century and documented the coming of age of its protagonist. As ideas of selfhood and of the individual’s relationship with society evolved in the context of urbanization, industrialization, gender, and democratic revolution, these novels grappled with what it meant to find, or reject, one’s place in society. Authors might include Goethe, Austen, Stendhal, Balzac, Brontë, Freytag, Fontane, and Schreiner, as well as 20th-century examplars like Joyce, Woolf, and Dangarembga, and key theorists of the genre.","title":"The Self and Society: The Novel of Development","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,1,8.5],"prerequisite":"YHU3210% Proseminar in Literary Studies or with the permission of the\ninstructor.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YHU4249","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1030","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-PgRm1","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1030","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-PgRm1","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18}]}],"prereqTree":"YHU3210"}
