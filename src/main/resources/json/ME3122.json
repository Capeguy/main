{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This course covers the key concepts related to the different modes of heat transfer (conduction, convection and radiation) and principles of heat exchangers. It develops the studentsâ proficiency in applying these heat transfer concepts and principles, to analyse and solve practical engineering problems involving heat transfer processes. Topics include introduction to heat transfer; steady state heat conduction; transient heat conduction; lumped capacitance; introduction to convective heat transfer; external forced convection; internal forced convection; natural/free convection; blackbody radiation and radiative properties; radiative exchange between surfaces; introduction to heat exchangers and basic calculation of overall heat transfer coefficient.","title":"Heat Transfer","department":"Mechanical Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[3,0.5,0.5,1.5,4.5],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"ME3122","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT3","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":145},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT1","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":145}],"examDate":"2019-11-27T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"fulfillRequirements":["ESP4401","ME4225","ME4226"]}
