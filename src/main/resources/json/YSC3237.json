{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"Precludes previous module codes of YSC3220 Rings and Fields & YSC3204 Group Theory, which have been consolidated into a single course YSC3237 Introduction to Modern Algebra.","description":"Algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules used to manipulate them. Throughout the history of mathematics, algebraic methods have been developed to solve equations using simple, but important, properties of numbers that make meaningful calculations possible. Those properties arise in a variety of other settings, however, allowing us to make algebraic arguments in a significantly broader context. This course introduces modern algebra â specifically the mathematical objects called groups and rings â through a rigorous exploration of familiar notions, including permutations, symmetries, polynomials, and matrices, resulting in a cohesive, unifying theory with far-reaching applications throughout the natural sciences.","title":"Introduction to Modern Algebra","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,4,0,4,4],"prerequisite":"YSC2209 Proof","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSC3237","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1030","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-CR20","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1430","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-CR20","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1030","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-CR20","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18}],"examDate":"2019-11-25T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":180}],"prereqTree":"YSC2209","fulfillRequirements":["YSC4202"]}
