{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module focuses on the ways in which modern science and technology impact on the forms-of-life which cultures and societies have built up for their collective self-understanding and biological survival. Issues in epistemology and how changes in the concept of &quot;reason&quot; have contributed to the project of modernity will be explored. The role of technology in its simultaneous creation and destruction of social-material wealth will also be considered. This discussion will be tied to an examination of certain key issues in environmental ethics, social theory, and cultural studies.","title":"Knowledge, Modernity and Global Change","department":"Philosophy","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,0,7],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PH3213","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS3-0523","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":25},{"classNo":"W1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1000","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS3-0523","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25}],"examDate":"2019-11-27T05:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}]}
