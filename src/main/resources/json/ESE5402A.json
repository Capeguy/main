{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This course introduces the advanced physical and chemical\ntreatment technologies that can be used for various\nindustrial wastewater treatment. Major issues will include the\nremoval of particles, heavy metal ions, emerging\ncontaminants, organic and oil species, etc. for water quality\nassurance, enhancement or water reclamation/wastewater\nreuse. The topics will cover neutralization, coagulation,\nsedimentation or flotation, granular filtration and membrane\nseparation, adsorption and advanced oxidation. This course\nwill expose students to the challenges and solutions for\nvarious industrial wastewater pollution controls.","title":"Physico-Chemical Treatment for Industrial Wastewater","department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[3,0,0,0.5,1.5],"moduleCredit":"2","moduleCode":"ESE5402A","attributes":{"lab":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2100","weeks":{"start":"2020-02-05","end":"2020-02-26"},"venue":"EA-06-05","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2100","weeks":[4,5,6],"venue":"E5-02-32","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40}]}]}
